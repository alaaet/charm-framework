## Abstract

This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) undertakes a comprehensive evaluation of the current state of academic research concerning the human factor in cybersecurity threats, synthesizing literature published between 2010 and 2025. Recognizing that human behavior, errors, and decision-making processes are central to a significant percentage of cybersecurity incidents, with the most recent analyses attributing 74% of breaches to the human element (Verizon, 2023)**,** while the World Economic Forum's (WEF) 2022 Global Risks Report states that 95% of cybersecurity issues can be traced to human error (WEF, 2022). This review analyzes literature from reputable databases (IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, Web of Science)<sup>[\[1\]](#footnote-1)</sup> to identify key themes, existing research gaps, and analyze established frameworks.

The review highlights persistent vulnerabilities arising from human error, social engineering susceptibility, insider threats (both negligent and malicious), inadequate security awareness, and cognitive biases, often exacerbated by organizational factors such as security culture, management support, and workload stress. Existing cybersecurity frameworks frequently lack sufficient integration of psychological principles and context-specific guidance, often treating the human as a simple component to be fixed rather than an integral part of the system**.** The expected outcomes of this SLR include a detailed categorization of human factors, an analysis of the limitations in current research, and the identification of recurring patterns. Ultimately, this review aims to propose potential components for a novel, comprehensive framework integrating psychological, organizational, and technological aspects, thereby enhancing the understanding and mitigation of the human factor in the context of cybersecurity. The keywords guiding this review include _"human factor", "cybersecurity threats", "systematic literature review", "human error", "social engineering", "insider threats", and "cybersecurity framework"._

## Introduction

In an era defined by pervasive digital transformation and hyper-connectivity, cybersecurity has evolved from a specialized technical discipline into a fundamental pillar of organizational resilience and national security. This evolution is characterized by a relentless arms race, where sophisticated technological defenses are continuously challenged by the adaptive and increasingly complex tactics of malicious actors. However, amidst the focus on technological fortifications, a critical and often underestimated dimension consistently emerges as the fulcrum of cyber risk: the human factor. Recognizing that security is not merely a technological problem, but a profound socio-technical challenge is essential for developing effective and sustainable defense strategies. _Human factors_ in cybersecurity refer to the behavioral, cognitive, psychological, social, and organizational attributes of individuals and groups that contribute either to security vulnerabilities or to resilience. This concept encompasses four interrelated domains: (1) individual factors-including cognitive biases, personality traits, knowledge, and awareness; (2) behavioral factors-such as compliance behaviors, workarounds, and security practices; (3) organizational factors-covering security culture, leadership support, policy design, and workload; and (4) socio-technical factors-such as human-computer interaction, usability, and system design. Establishing this definition at the outset provides a conceptual foundation for the scope of this review and guides the inclusion and exclusion criteria applied in the methodology (Bowers & Sasse, 2021; Nurse et al., 2014; Proctor Robert W.  and Vu, 2022).

The contemporary digital landscape is characterized by an ever-increasing reliance on interconnected systems, making cybersecurity a paramount concern for organizations across all sectors. While significant advancements have been made by both academics and professionals in developing sophisticated technical defenses, such as encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, human behavior continues to play a defining role in the success or failure of security initiatives. Human actions, decisions, cognitive biases, and inherent vulnerabilities significantly shape an organization's overall security posture. Paradoxically, while often cited as a primary source of weakness, the human element-through ingenuity, vigilance, and adaptability-also holds potential as a key strength in identifying novel threats and developing innovative security solutions. While experts view humans as the "weakest link" due to errors, some argue for perceiving humans as the "strongest link" for positive reinforcement and to encourage employees to function as "security ambassadors" within the organization (Ergen et al., 2021).

Statistics from numerous studies consistently underscore the profound impact of the human factor. The 2023 Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report found that 74% of all breaches involved a human element, including errors, social engineering, and misuse (Verizon, 2023). Similarly, IBM's 2023 report noted that the most common initial attack vectors were phishing and stolen credentials, highlighting that breaches caused by social engineering took, on average, the longest to identify and contain (IBM Security, 2023). Phishing attacks, quintessential examples of exploiting human psychology, remain a dominant threat vector, alongside insider threats (both malicious and accidental) and simple human errors in system configuration or data handling. This consistent pattern highlights a critical need to move beyond purely technical viewpoints and thoroughly understand the nuanced role of human factors in cybersecurity strategies. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats, coupled with the expanding attack surface presented by trends like remote work and the Internet of Things (IoT), necessitates a continuous re-evaluation and a more integrated understanding of this human dimension.

The observation regarding the conflicting statistics-74% from Verizon's 2023 Data Breach Investigations Report and 95% from the World Economic Forum's 2022 Global Risks Report -highlights a common challenge in interpreting cybersecurity data. Reported human-factor contributions vary widely across industry sources (e.g., **74% vs. 95%**), which underscores the need for a **systematic academic synthesis** to (i) verify claims against peer-reviewed evidence, (ii) explain methodological differences, and (iii) identify consensus patterns practitioners can trust. The understanding of the 'human factor' itself is not static; it is a concept continuously being defined and refined by various reports and academic studies. This dynamic definition emphasizes that a thorough analysis must go beyond simple numbers and dive into the specific context and scope of each reported incident. Further explanations of the complex human behaviors leading to cybersecurity incidents can be found in the research by (Ergen et al., 2021, p. 215).

## 2\. Motivation

### 2.1. Problem Statement: The Persistent Challenge of Human-Related Vulnerabilities

Despite the growing recognition of the human factor's importance, a persistent challenge endures, as organizations continue to face difficulties in addressing vulnerabilities arising from human factors. Despite substantial investments in technological controls, human-related vulnerabilities remain under-addressed in the organizational security strategies that we identified. This creates a critical gap, as technical defenses alone are insufficient to counter threats that exploit human psychology, cognitive limitations, or simple mistakes. The consistent high figures across multiple reputable reports underscore the imperative for organizations to adopt a people-centric security strategy that complements technological defenses with robust security awareness, continuous training, and human-centric controls. The evolving threat landscape, increasingly influenced by advanced tools like artificial intelligence (AI), further amplifies the need to strengthen the human layer of defense.

The existing literature, while acknowledging the socio-technical nature of cybersecurity, reveals significant gaps, particularly in the development of robust theoretical frameworks and context-specific studies. Many current frameworks, including widely adopted standards like the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0** or **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**, offer high-level guidance but often lack specific, actionable direction on integrating psychological principles, shaping security-conscious organizational cultures, or addressing the complex interplay between human behavior and technology usability(_ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection - Information Security Management Systems - Requirements_, 2022; National Institute of Standards & Technology, 2024). Their guidance frequently defaults to awareness campaigns, which have limited efficacy in producing sustained behavioral change (Bada & Nurse, 2019). Furthermore, research methodologies often rely on self-reported data or simulations, which may not accurately capture real-world behaviors, and there is a notable lack of longitudinal studies assessing the long-term effectiveness of interventions (Canham et al., 2021). This persistent challenge underscores the need for a systematic synthesis of current knowledge to identify specific human vulnerabilities, evaluate existing mitigation approaches, and develop more comprehensive, evidence-based strategies.

### 2.2. Research Question and Objectives

This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) aims to address the identified gaps and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the human factor in cybersecurity threats within organizational settings. Several prior systematic reviews have addressed aspects of human factors in cybersecurity, including reviews focusing on specific sectors such as healthcare (Nifakos et al., 2021), reviews examining specific attack vectors such as phishing (Desolda et al., 2022), and reviews exploring multi-perspective human cybersecurity behavior (Alsharida et al., 2023). While these reviews provide valuable insights, they are often limited in either scope, timeframe, or conceptual integration, leaving open the need for a holistic synthesis that bridges these dimensions.

A systematic literature review (SLR) was selected as the most appropriate methodological approach because it enables a comprehensive and transparent synthesis of evidence across diverse disciplines investigating the human factor in cybersecurity. By systematically identifying, evaluating, and integrating findings from quantitative, qualitative, and mixed-methods studies, the SLR approach allows for mapping patterns and relationships that individual studies cannot reveal. It also ensures methodological rigor and replicability through explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria, standardized data extraction, and structured synthesis following PRISMA 2020 guidelines (Page et al., 2021). This systematic synthesis provides a robust foundation for identifying research gaps and constructing an integrative framework that unifies psychological, organizational, and technological perspectives.

In this context, the present review distinguishes itself by:

- focusing on organizational settings across all sectors (not limited to a specific industry).
- comprehensively covering the period 2010-2025 to capture the most recent developments.
- integrating psychological, organizational, and technological aspects within a unified analysis.
- proposing components for a novel, integrative framework that addresses identified gaps in existing approaches.

The central research question guiding this review is:

- **What are the primary human factors that contribute to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in organizational settings based on peer-reviewed literature from 2010-2025?**

To answer this question, we established the following specific objectives:

- To identify and categorize key human factors-behavioral, cognitive, social, and organizational-consistently cited in the literature as contributing to cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
- To analyze the relationships between these identified human factors and specific types of cybersecurity incidents (e.g., phishing success, data breaches, insider actions).
- To investigate the influence of organizational context (e.g., culture, management support, policies, workload) on human-related cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
- To critically evaluate the methodologies employed in existing studies assessing human factors and cybersecurity behavior, identifying strengths and limitations.
- To identify significant gaps in the current body of research and propose directions for future investigation.
- To synthesize findings and develop a conceptual foundation for a novel, integrative framework that integrates psychological, organizational, and technological aspects thereby enhancing the understanding and mitigation of human-related cybersecurity risks.

Collectively, these objectives operationalize the central research question by ensuring that each dimension of inquiry directly contributes to its resolution. Objective 1 identifies and categorizes the human factors most frequently associated with cybersecurity vulnerabilities, providing the empirical foundation for answering what those factors are. Objective 2 analyzes the relationships between the identified factors and specific incident types, clarifying how these factors contribute to vulnerabilities. Objective 3 situates these dynamics within the organizational context specified in the research question, while Objective 4 evaluates the methodological rigor of existing studies to ensure the validity of the synthesized evidence. Objective 5 addresses the discovery of research gaps that extend the understanding of the human factor beyond current knowledge, and Objective 6 integrates all preceding insights into a conceptual framework that consolidates psychological, organizational, and technological perspectives. Together, these objectives provide a comprehensive pathway for addressing the review's overarching question.

### 2.3. Scope

We confined the scope of this review to peer-reviewed academic literature, including empirical research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses, published between January 2010 and May 2025. This review focuses on the integration of psychological, organizational, and socio-technical aspects of the human factor contributing to cybersecurity vulnerabilities in organizational contexts, excluding studies centered solely on individual or home users. The synthesis aims to produce an integrative framework that consolidates these dimensions into coherent components to guide future research and practice.

### 2.4. Reconciling Discrepancies: Definitions, Scope, and Methodology

The primary reason for numerical differences in reported percentages of human-related cyber incidents, such as between Verizon's 74% and the WEF's 95% figure, stems from distinct definitions of "human element" or "human error," varying scopes of incidents analyzed, and differing methodologies employed by each reporting entity. Understanding these nuances is key to a meaningful comparison.

A comparative analysis of how "human element" or "human error" is defined and measured across various reports reveals significant distinctions:

- Verizon's "Human Element" (74%): This is clearly defined as breaches involving Error, Privilege Misuse, Use of stolen credentials, or Social Engineering. This definition is specific to breaches (incidents with confirmed data loss) and focuses on the direct human action or vulnerability exploited to facilitate that breach.
- WEF's "Human Error" (95%): The World Economic Forum's 2022 Global Risks Report explicitly states: "Businesses also operate in a world in which 95% of cybersecurity issues can be traced to human error, and where insider threats (intentional or accidental) represent 43% of all breaches." This figure refers to "cybersecurity issues" and "cybersecurity breaches" caused by "human error." The report does not provide a specific definition for "human error" within this context, which could imply a broader scope than just direct attack vectors, potentially including accidental misconfigurations, unintentional data exposure, or a general lack of adherence to security policies, which might not always culminate in a "breach" as narrowly defined by Verizon. Mimecast's State of Human Risk 2025 report also attributes 95% of cybersecurity breaches to human error.
- Kaspersky's "Human Factor" (64%): The Kaspersky Human Factor 360° report 2023 provides a highly specific definition for its 64% figure: "all cyber incidents in the past two years were caused by employees' intentional information security policies violations". It further breaks this down into categories like accidental human error (38%), non-IT employee policy violations (8%), IT staff policy violations (12%), and intentional malicious behavior from senior IT security workers (11%) (Kaspersky, 2023). This definition is comprehensive in its internal focus, encompassing both unintentional errors and deliberate policy violations by various employee types.

The scope of analysis also varies significantly:

- Verizon's Focus: The 74% figure from Verizon specifically refers to "confirmed data breaches". This narrower scope, limited to incidents with verified data loss, inherently excludes many "human errors" or "incidents" that do not result in a confirmed breach (Verizon, 2023).
- WEF's (as stated): The WEF's 95% figure refers to "cybersecurity issues" and "cybersecurity breaches", which could imply a broader scope encompassing a wider range of security incidents, not just those with confirmed data disclosure (WEF, 2022).
- Kaspersky: This report explicitly refers to "all cyber incidents", which is a significantly broader scope than just "breaches." Analyzing all incidents, rather than just those with confirmed data loss, would naturally yield a different, and potentially higher, percentage of human involvement (Kaspersky, 2023).

Furthermore, methodological differences play a crucial role. Each report relies on distinct data collection methods, analytical frameworks, and reporting focuses. For example, Verizon's DBIR uses real-world breaches and incidents investigated by their Threat Research Advisory Center (VTRAC) and global contributors, categorized using the VERIS Framework. The WEF's reports are underpinned by Global Risks Perception Surveys from a wide array of experts across academia, business, government, and civil society. Variations in survey questions, the specific types of data sources (e.g., internal incident reports vs. public breach disclosures), and the analytical models applied will inevitably lead to different statistical outcomes. The apparent discrepancy is therefore not a contradiction but a reflection of different analytical lenses. Verizon provides a precise, incident-driven statistics for breaches based on a defined "human element." The 95% figure from WEF likely stems from a broader assessment of "cybersecurity issues" or "human error" that might include a wider array of human-influenced vulnerabilities or a different data collection methodology (e.g., expert opinion vs. confirmed incident data). The varying definitions used by Verizon and Kaspersky demonstrate that the "human element" is not a monolithic concept. Different reports quantify different facets of human involvement in cyber incidents. Verizon's focus might emphasize external exploitation of human weaknesses, while Kaspersky's detailed breakdown highlights the spectrum of internal human actions, from accidental errors to deliberate malicious behavior. The broader "human error" cited by WEF likely encompasses an even wider array of human-related issues. This implies that organizations should move beyond a simplistic view of "human error" as a single problem. Instead, they need to disaggregate it into specific categories of human actions and vulnerabilities (e.g., susceptibility to phishing, accidental data leaks, insider threats, privilege abuse, weak password hygiene) to develop targeted and effective mitigation strategies. A nuanced understanding of how humans contribute to incidents is far more valuable than a single aggregate percentage.

The core reconciliation point for the numerical differences lies in understanding definitional differences, scope variations, and even issues of secondary attribution (the WEF 95% being a third-party citation). Simply comparing percentages without understanding the underlying definitions, methodologies, and the specific scope of the data (e.g., "breaches" vs. "all incidents") is inherently misleading. A higher reported percentage might indicate a broader definition of "human involvement" or a wider dataset, rather than necessarily a worse human security posture in one organization compared to another. Cybersecurity leaders must exercise extreme caution and conduct due diligence when interpreting and comparing statistics across different reports. This critical evaluation ensures that strategic investments and policy decisions are based on relevant, accurately interpreted, and contextually appropriate data, rather than potentially misleading headline figures.

Table 1: Key Statistics on Human-Related Cyber Incidents

| Report Source | Year | Percentage | Definition/Scope of "Human Element" | Key Context/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Verizon DBIR (Verizon, 2023) | 2023 | 74% | "People being involved either via Error, Privilege Misuse, Use of stolen credentials or Social Engineering." Applies to confirmed data breaches. | Based on 5,199 confirmed breaches from 16,312 security incidents. Social Engineering is a top pattern. |
| WEF Global Risks Report (WEF, 2022) | 2022 | 95% | "Cybersecurity issues can be traced to human error" / "cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error." | Stated directly in the WEF 2022 report. WEF reports focus on broader global risks and expert perceptions. WEF mentions social engineering as a top concern, insider threats, and skills gaps. |
| Kaspersky Human Factor 360° Report (Kaspersky, 2023) | 2023 | 64% | "Employees' intentional information security policies violations, accidental human error by IT security staff, and errors caused by other IT staff." Apply to all cyber incidents. | Based on "all cyber incidents" in the past two years. Breakdown includes 38% accidental human error, 8% non-IT policy violation, 12% IT staff policy violation, 11% intentional malicious behavior from senior IT security workers. |
| World Economic Forum Global Cybersecurity Outlook (WEF, 2025) | 2025 | 42% | "Organizations reporting phishing and social engineering attacks" in 2024. | This is a specific attack vector percentage from a later WEF report, illustrating ongoing concern for human-targeted attacks. |
| Proofpoint Human Factor Report (Proofpoint, 2025) | 2022/2023 | 70% | Focus on "people-centric threats and user risks." Emphasizes human psychology as vulnerable. | Discusses specific human-centric attack vectors like social engineering, MFA-bypass, TOAD messages, and targeting of "Very Attacked People (VAPs)" like executives. No overall percentage provided in snippets. |

The table above serves to clearly present and compare the reported percentages from Verizon, the attributed WEF figure, and other relevant reports, alongside their respective definitions or contexts of "human element" or "human error." This directly addresses the user's core query and highlights definitional differences. By including the "Definition/Scope" column, it directly shows why the numbers differ - they are measuring slightly different things, or the definition is not consistently applied across reports. This is a crucial observation. The "Key Context/Notes" column provides essential background on the report's focus and methodology (e.g., confirmed breaches vs. all incidents vs. perception survey), which is vital for accurate interpretation. This reinforces the observation that comparing these figures can be like comparing apples to oranges. By consolidating this information, the table provides a concise, easy-to-digest comparison, enhancing clarity and readability for a busy executive audience. Finally, the table visually reinforces the point that a single percentage is insufficient and that understanding the underlying definitions and methodologies is paramount for effective risk assessment.

This figure provides a visual comparison of the percentages reported by major cybersecurity sources (e.g., Verizon 2023, WEF 2022, Kaspersky 2023), illustrating relative magnitudes and variability among them. Whereas Table 1 details definitions, scopes, and methodological contexts for each report, this figure summarizes the same data graphically to highlight the discrepancies that motivate this review's critical analysis of human-factor statistics.

### 2.5. Document Structure

In this paper, we organize our systematic review into seven primary sections to ensure a logical flow of information. We begin by establishing the motivation, problem statement, and scope in Section 2. Section 3 details our search strategy and PRISMA-based methodology. We then present our thematic analysis of human factors in Section 4, followed by a critical discussion of research gaps in Section 5. Finally, we propose a novel framework in Section 6 before concluding with summary remarks and future directions in Section 7.

## 3\. Research Methodology

To conduct this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), a structured and transparent approach was employed to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased analysis of the existing academic literature concerning the human factor in cybersecurity threats within organizational settings. This methodology adheres to the principles outlined in the **Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines** (Page et al., 2021).

### 3.1. Search Strategy

The initial step involved formulating a detailed search strategy designed to identify relevant studies published between January 2010 and May 2025. We selected this timeframe to capture contemporary research reflecting the evolution of both cyber threats and the understanding of human factors in the digital age. The search strategy aimed to be comprehensive, covering multiple facets of the human element in relation to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. We used an iterative approach, refining search terms based on preliminary results to ensure adequate coverage of the relevant literature.

### 3.2. Searched Databases

We selected reputable academic databases known for their coverage of computer science, information systems, cybersecurity, psychology, and management literature as primary sources. The selection of multiple, high-quality databases is a key recommendation for ensuring comprehensive coverage in information systems research (vom Brocke et al., 2015). The databases systematically searched included:

- IEEE Xplore
- ACM Digital Library
- Scopus
- Web of Science

We chose these databases for their extensive indexing of peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings, and relevant scholarly publications in the target fields.

### 3.3. Used Keywords

We utilized a combination of keywords and search terms related to the core concepts of the review. Boolean operators (AND, OR) were employed to structure the search queries effectively. The primary keywords and concepts included variations and synonyms of:

- **Human Factor Concepts:** _"human factor", "human error", "user behavior", "cognitive bias", "human aspect", "psychological factors", "insider threat", "social engineering"_
- **Cybersecurity Concepts:** _"cybersecurity", "cyber security", "information security", "cyber threat", "security breach", "vulnerability", "data breach", "cyber-attack"_
- **Context/Outcome Concepts:** _"organizational setting", "workplace", "enterprise", "framework", "mitigation", "compliance", "awareness"_

_Table 2: Keyword classification_

| **_Concept Category_** | **_Keywords and Synonyms_** |
| --- | --- |
| **_Human Factor Concepts_** | "Human factor", "human error", "user behavior", "cognitive bias", "human aspect", "psychological factors", "insider threat", "social engineering" |
| **_Cybersecurity Concepts_** | "Cybersecurity", "cyber security", "information security", "cyber threat", "security breach", "vulnerability", "data breach", "cyber-attack" |
| **_Context/Outcome Concepts_** | "Organizational setting", "workplace", "enterprise", "framework", "mitigation", "compliance", "awareness" |

Example search strings combined these terms, such as: _("human factor\*" OR "human error" OR "social engineering") AND ("cybersecurity" OR "information security") AND (vulnerability\* OR breach\* OR threat\*) AND (organization\* OR enterprise)_

The search terms were adapted as necessary to suit the specific syntax requirements of each database. Given that each database applies distinct search syntax and field structures, multiple database-specific search strings were developed and refined iteratively based on preliminary results. The core Boolean logic and keyword groupings remained constant across searches, while truncations, field restrictions, and operator conventions were adjusted for compatibility with each platform (e.g., IEEE Xplore, ACM DL, Scopus, Web of Science).

### 3.4. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We established a clear criterion _a priori_ to guide the selection of studies for inclusion in the review:

- **Inclusion Criteria:**
  - Studies that are explicitly focusing on human factors (behavioral, cognitive, social, organizational) contributing to cybersecurity vulnerabilities or incidents.
  - Research conducted within an organizational or workplace setting.
  - Empirical studies (quantitative, qualitative, mixed-methods), systematic reviews, or meta-analyses presenting evidence-based findings.
  - Peer-reviewed publications (journal articles, conference papers).
  - Studies that were published between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2025.
  - Books and Reports (Governmental and Industrial) could be used to criticize and discuss the publications under study.
  - Studies published in the English language.
- **Exclusion Criteria:**
  - Studies focusing solely on technical aspects of cybersecurity without a significant human factor component.
  - Studies focused exclusively on non-organizational contexts (e.g., home users, general public) unless findings were explicitly related back to organizational implications.
  - Non-peer-reviewed literature (e.g., blog posts, white papers, news articles, editorials, opinion pieces).
  - Studies published outside the specified date range or in languages other than English.
  - Articles that were not formally published.
  - Duplicate publications of the same study.

These inclusion and exclusion criteria were consistently applied during the screening and eligibility stages, and all exclusions were recorded according to PRISMA 2020 guidance. While detailed counts for each exclusion category were not retained, the overall process is illustrated in the PRISMA flow diagram (Section 2.5) (Page et al., 2021).

### 3.5. Study Selection Process (PRISMA)

The study selection process followed a systematic screening procedure, documented using a PRISMA flow diagram. Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved records and independently reviewed the full texts that passed this stage. Conflicts were resolved through discussion and consensus. Inter-rater agreement was 89% at the title/abstract stage and 94% at the full-text review stage.

We illustrate the complete selection and exclusion workflow in **Figure 2**, which outlines the following stages:

- **Identification:** Initial searches across the selected databases yielded a total of 665 records. After removing duplicates, 518 records remained.
- **Screening:** We screened titles and abstracts of the 518 records based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Excluded 153 records at this stage as they were clearly irrelevant (e.g., wrong topic, wrong context). This left 272 articles for full-text assessment.
- **Eligibility:** We thoroughly reviewed the full texts of the remaining 272 articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Excluded 142 articles during this phase for reasons such as not focusing sufficiently on human factors, lacking empirical data (if not a review), being conducted in an inappropriate setting, or not meeting other criteria.
- **Inclusion:** A final set of 133 studies met all criteria and were included in the systematic literature review for data extraction and synthesis, of the 133 studies, 112 are peer-reviewed academic studies, and the remaining 18 references were included for necessity, these are categorized as follows: 7 industry reports, 2 government reports, 1 standard, 6 frameworks and methodologies, 3 books, and 2 editorial articles.

### 3.6. Data Extraction

A structured data extraction form was developed and utilized to systematically collect relevant information from each of the 133 included studies. The form captured key details, including:

- Author(s) and Publication Year
- Study Objectives / Research Questions
- Study Design and Methodology (e.g., qualitative, quantitative, SLR, sample size, context)
- Identified Human Factors Contributing to Vulnerabilities
- Key Findings related to human factors and cybersecurity.
- Mentioned Frameworks or Models
- Reported Mitigation Strategies or Recommendations
- Identified Research Gaps or Limitations mentioned by authors.

We performed data extraction meticulously to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### 3.7. Quality Assessment

While this review did not employ a formal quantitative scoring of studies, the quality and relevance of the included literature were critically appraised. The selection process inherently prioritized peer-reviewed literature, which provides a baseline quality filter. During the synthesis phase, we considered the rigor of the methodology, clarity of objectives, and coherence of findings within each study. This appraisal was guided by the principles within established critical appraisal tools, such as the **Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklists** (Critical Appraisal Skills Programme, 2018). We also noted and factored methodological limitations reported by the authors of the primary studies into the analysis. All 133 studies that met the inclusion criteria satisfied the baseline quality threshold required for inclusion; consequently, no studies were excluded solely on the basis of quality appraisal. The assessment outcomes were used to contextualize the strength of evidence during synthesis rather than to determine eligibility, ensuring that quality considerations informed interpretation without narrowing the evidence base.

### 3.8. Data Synthesis Technique

A thematic synthesis approach was employed to analyze the extracted data. This technique is well-suited for integrating evidence from diverse study types (qualitative and quantitative) to answer broad review questions (Thomas & Harden, 2008). This involved identifying recurring themes, patterns, and concepts across the included studies related to human factors, vulnerabilities, organizational context, and mitigation strategies. The process included:

- Familiarization with the extracted data.
- Generating a mind map based on recurring concepts.
- Grouping concepts into potential themes.
- Reviewing and refining themes based on the breadth and depth of evidence.
- Defining and naming the final themes presented in the Results section.

This approach allowed for a qualitative synthesis of findings from diverse study types.

## 4\. Results: Thematic Analysis of Human Factors

The systematic review and thematic synthesis of the 133 included studies revealed several recurring and interconnected themes concerning the human factors that contribute significantly to cybersecurity vulnerabilities within organizations. We can broadly categorize these themes into: (1) Individual Behavioral and Psychological Factors, (2) Social Engineering Susceptibility, (3) Insider Threats, (4) Organizational Factors, and (5) Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Usability Factors.

Table 3: Human factors themes

| _Main Theme_ | _Sub-Theme_ | _Key Finding from Literature_ | _Key Supporting References_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **_Individual Factors_** | Human Error | Unintentional mistakes (misconfiguration, data mishandling) are a root cause of many incidents, based on predictable patterns. | (Grandhi & Still, 2025; Patterson & Shappell, 2010; Proctor Robert W.  and Vu, 2022) |
| Cognitive Biases | Systematic errors in judgment (e.g., optimism, availability) lead to poor risk perception and decision-making. | (Aschwanden et al., 2024; Hagen et al., 2025; Kahneman, 2011; McCormac et al., 2017) |
| **_Social Engineering_** | Phishing | Deceptive communications remain highly effective by exploiting human psychology, trust, and cognitive heuristics. | (Algarni et al., 2016; Bowen et al., 2011; Desolda et al., 2022; Iuga et al., 2016; Jozani et al., 2021; Kirlappos et al., 2013; Siew et al., 2025; Vishwanath, 2011, 2020; Yasin et al., 2024) |
| **_Insider Threats_** | Negligent & Malicious | Threats from within are driven by both unintentional carelessness and specific malicious motivations (revenge, financial gain). | (Canham et al., 2021; Caputo et al., 2014; Greitzer et al., 2010; Zangana et al., 2025) |
| **_Organizational Factors_** | Security Culture | Shared beliefs and norms, driven by leadership, are a primary influence on employee compliance and overall security posture. | (da Veiga & Eloff, 2010; Dornheim & Zarnekow, 2023; Eslami et al., 2019; Georgiadou et al., 2020; Hina & Lowry, 2020; Hu et al., 2012; Huang & Pearlson, 2019; Pavlova, 2020; Pollini et al., 2021; Reegård et al., 2019; Schlegel et al., 2022; Zangana et al., 2025) |
| **_HCI & Usability_** | Usability Challenges | Security controls that are difficult to use or disrupt workflow are often bypassed by users, creating new vulnerabilities. | (Adams Anne  and Sasse, 2021; Luan et al., 2023; Sadeghi Milani et al., 2024; Stefanidi et al., 2023) |

### 4.1. Individual Behavioral and Psychological Factors

This theme consolidates literature examining how individual-level cognitive, psychological, and behavioral characteristics shape cybersecurity outcomes in organizational settings. Rather than treating users as a homogeneous source of error, the reviewed studies collectively demonstrate that insecure behavior emerges from predictable cognitive mechanisms, situational pressures, and stable psychological traits. For analytical clarity, these factors are structured into six interrelated dimensions: (i) unintentional human error, (ii) security awareness and knowledge gaps, (iii) credential management behavior, (iv) cognitive biases and judgment heuristics, (v) transient psychological states, and (vi) stable behavioral predispositions and user profiles.

#### 4.1.1 Unintentional Human Error

Unintentional human error is one of the most consistently identified contributors to cybersecurity incidents across sectors (Proctor Robert W.  and Vu, 2022). Importantly, the literature emphasizes that such errors are rarely random; instead, they follow recurring patterns shaped by workflow design, cognitive load, and organizational constraints (Grandhi & Still, 2025; Patterson & Shappell, 2010).

Common manifestations include system and cloud misconfigurations (Chamkar et al., 2022; Nifakos et al., 2021), accidental data disclosure through incorrect recipients or improper storage(Corradini, 2020), delayed or neglected software patching driven by operational pressures (Arce et al., 2020), and procedural deviations such as bypassing authentication steps or ignoring security warnings. Empirical evidence shows that these behaviors are often rationalized as necessary trade-offs to maintain productivity, rather than deliberate negligence (Coventry et al., 2014).

Across studies, insecure actions are associated with recurring motivational and contextual drivers, including preference for convenience, habituation to warnings, perceived low likelihood of harm, incomplete mental models of risk, social norms encouraging trust-based sharing, and the delegation of security responsibility to IT departments. Collectively, these findings reinforce the view that human error is a systemic outcome of socio-technical conditions rather than an individual failure.

#### 4.1.2 Security Awareness and Knowledge Deficits

Insufficient security awareness remains a pervasive vulnerability influencing employees' risk perception and compliance behavior (Bulgurcu et al., 2010). While most organizations deploy awareness programs, the literature consistently reports limited long-term behavioral impact when training is generic, infrequent, or decoupled from daily work practices (Bada & Nurse, 2019).

Comparative evaluations of training delivery methods reveal that effectiveness varies by modality and threat type. (Abawajy, 2014) demonstrates that blended approaches combining textual, video-based, and interactive elements outperform single-method training. Video-based instruction is more effective for email phishing detection, while game-based approaches-despite lower user preference-are associated with reduced false positives in website phishing identification. These findings suggest that awareness interventions should be task-specific rather than universally applied.

Extending this perspective, (Desolda et al., 2022) adapt human factors models from aviation safety to cybersecurity, identifying twelve recurrent contributors to insecure behavior, including lack of communication, complacency, distraction, fatigue, stress, pressure, norms, and resource constraints. This framework highlights that awareness deficits are intertwined with organizational and cognitive conditions rather than isolated knowledge gaps.

#### 4.1.3 Password and Credential Management Behavior

Weak credential practices continue to represent a fundamental vulnerability in organizational security. Studies consistently report password reuse, weak password selection, and insecure storage as dominant risk factors (Ho et al., 2019; Shay et al., 2010). These behaviors reflect the cognitive burden associated with managing multiple credentials rather than simple ignorance of best practices.

Although password-strength education is widespread, evidence suggests that informational interventions alone are insufficient to sustain secure behavior (Pratama et al., 2023). Users often prioritize memorability and task efficiency over theoretical security benefits, underscoring the need for usability-aware authentication mechanisms that reduce reliance on human memory.

#### 4.1.4 Cognitive Biases and Judgment Errors

A substantial body of literature demonstrates that cognitive biases systematically distort security-related decision-making (Kahneman, 2011; McCormac et al., 2017). Among the most frequently observed biases are optimism bias, which leads individuals to underestimate their personal exposure to threats (Wiederhold, 2014); availability heuristics, which skew risk perception toward highly publicized incidents; confirmation bias, which causes users to dismiss warnings that conflict with existing beliefs (Hagen et al., 2025); and anchoring bias, which results in overreliance on initial cues when assessing legitimacy.

These biases increase susceptibility to manipulation, reduce compliance with protective behaviors, and impair response quality during security incidents. Importantly, their effects persist even among technically proficient users, challenging the assumption that expertise alone mitigates human vulnerability.

#### 4.1.5 Transient Psychological States: Stress, Fatigue, and Cognitive Load

Temporary psychological states play a critical role in shaping cybersecurity behavior. High workload, stress, and fatigue have been empirically linked to increased policy violations and error rates (Ferguson-Walter et al., 2021). Under such conditions, attentional resources decline, reliance on heuristics increases, and security warnings are more likely to be ignored.

This effect extends beyond general employees to cybersecurity professionals themselves, particularly in high-pressure environments such as incident response. Integrative approaches combining insights from cognitive psychology and neuroscience emphasize the importance of resilience, recovery, and workload management as components of effective human-centric security strategies (Przymus et al., 2024).

#### 4.1.6 Stable Behavioral Traits and User Profiles

Beyond situational factors, stable psychological traits and behavioral tendencies significantly influence cybersecurity outcomes. Internet addiction has been identified as a predictor of risky security behavior, as compulsive online engagement encourages shortcut-taking and reduced protocol adherence (Hadlington, 2017). Impulsivity-particularly attentional and motor impulsiveness-positively correlates with insecure actions, whereas future-oriented thinking is associated with stronger policy compliance (Egelman & Peer, 2015; Moustafa et al., 2021).

Recent work advances this perspective by classifying employees into distinct cyber behavior profiles, ranging from cautious-unaware to risk-seeking-aware users (Przymus et al., 2024). Complementing this typology, (Aschwanden et al., 2024) identify psychologically grounded archetypes-Experts, Deportees, and Repressors-each shaped by specific cognitive biases such as overconfidence, diffusion of responsibility, or information avoidance. These findings collectively demonstrate that uniform awareness programs are unlikely to be effective; instead, tailored interventions aligned with underlying psychological drivers are required.

#### 4.1.7 Synthesis

Taken together, the literature portrays individual-level cybersecurity risk as the outcome of interacting cognitive biases, psychological states, habitual behaviors, and contextual pressures. Human error, therefore, should not be conceptualized as an isolated failure to be eliminated, but as a predictable and measurable component of socio-technical systems. This synthesis provides a structured foundation for subsequent themes-particularly social engineering susceptibility and insider threats-where these individual factors are systematically exploited or amplified.

### 4.2. Social Engineering Susceptibility

Social engineering represents one of the most persistent and effective categories of cyber threats precisely because it targets human cognition and social behavior rather than technical vulnerabilities. Across the reviewed literature, social engineering is consistently framed as a socio-technical phenomenon in which attackers deliberately exploit trust, authority, habit, time pressure, and cognitive heuristics embedded in organizational routines (Desolda et al., 2022; Jozani et al., 2021; Vishwanath, 2011). Unlike malware-based attacks, social engineering circumvents technical defenses by manipulating the decision-making processes of legitimate users, rendering purely technical countermeasures insufficient (Greavu-Serban & Constantin, 2022).

To improve analytical clarity and avoid conceptual overlap, this subsection structures social engineering susceptibility into five interrelated dimensions: (i) psychological and cognitive exploitation mechanisms, (ii) dominant attack vectors, (iii) individual susceptibility factors, (iv) organizational and contextual amplifiers, and (v) attack lifecycle models.

#### 4.2.1 Psychological and Cognitive Exploitation Mechanisms

At its core, social engineering operates by exploiting predictable cognitive shortcuts and emotional responses. The literature repeatedly emphasizes that individuals rely on heuristics-such as authority, urgency, reciprocity, and social proof-when making rapid decisions under uncertainty (Übelacker & Quiel, 2014; Vishwanath, 2011). Attackers intentionally design messages that trigger these heuristics, thereby reducing analytical scrutiny and increasing compliance.

Cognitive limitations further exacerbate this vulnerability. Humans are poorly equipped to assess low-frequency, high-impact risks, particularly when threats are embedded in familiar communication channels such as email or messaging platforms(Mulahuwaish et al., 2025). Time pressure, multitasking, and information overload-common characteristics of organizational work environments-magnify reliance on intuitive rather than deliberative processing, increasing susceptibility even among experienced users (Desolda et al., 2022).

#### 4.2.2 Dominant Social Engineering Attack Vectors

Among social engineering techniques, phishing and its variants remain the most extensively studied and prevalent vectors. Empirical studies consistently demonstrate high success rates across sectors, including government, healthcare, and higher education, with reported click-through rates ranging from 30% to over 60% in controlled experiments (Desolda et al., 2022; Moustafa et al., 2021).

Spear phishing represents a particularly effective evolution of this threat, leveraging personalized information to enhance credibility and relevance (Jozani et al., 2021). Attack effectiveness is further increased by the "prevalence effect," whereby users are less likely to detect malicious messages when phishing emails occur infrequently within normal communication flows (Desolda et al., 2022).

Beyond phishing, the literature documents a range of complementary techniques, including pretexting-where attackers fabricate credible identities or scenarios to elicit information (Ghafir et al., 2018); baiting, which exploits curiosity or perceived reward (Iuga et al., 2016); and quid pro quo attacks, where assistance or benefits are exchanged for access or credentials (Vishwanath, 2011). Collectively, these methods demonstrate that social engineering is not a single tactic, but a flexible strategy adapted to organizational context and target profile.

#### 4.2.3 Individual Susceptibility Factors

Susceptibility to social engineering varies significantly across individuals, challenging the notion of a uniformly vulnerable workforce. Personality traits have been shown to influence responsiveness to manipulation techniques. Research grounded in the Big Five personality model indicates that agreeableness is strongly associated with trust-based vulnerabilities, while extraversion increases susceptibility to social proof and scarcity cues (Übelacker & Quiel, 2014). Neuroticism and narcissistic traits have also been linked to higher phishing victimization rates under specific conditions (Moustafa et al., 2021).

Demographic and experiential factors further modulate risk. Younger users, particularly those aged 18-25, are consistently reported as more vulnerable to phishing, potentially due to divided attention, overconfidence, or habitual digital engagement(Desolda et al., 2022). Importantly, awareness alone does not reliably mitigate susceptibility; multiple studies demonstrate that users who can accurately describe phishing indicators still fail to apply this knowledge under realistic conditions (Vishwanath, 2020).

#### 4.2.4 Organizational and Contextual Amplifiers

_This subsection considers organizational conditions only insofar as they directly amplify or constrain the effectiveness of social engineering attacks. Broader organizational structures, governance mechanisms, and security management practices are examined separately in Section 4.4._

Organizational conditions significantly shape the effectiveness of social engineering attacks. Security culture emerges as a critical moderating factor: environments that prioritize speed, helpfulness, and uninterrupted workflow inadvertently reinforce attacker narratives that exploit urgency and authority (Greavu-Serban & Constantin, 2022). In such settings, employees may perceive compliance with suspicious requests as aligned with organizational expectations rather than as policy violations.

Operational realities further amplify risk. Social engineering attacks are highly adaptive, often preceded by prolonged reconnaissance phases that may span months or years, enabling attackers to align messages with internal structures, hierarchies, and communication norms (Greavu-Serban & Constantin, 2022). In critical infrastructure contexts-such as healthcare, emergency services, and military operations-non-technical staff operate under extreme time pressure, making complete prevention economically or operationally infeasible and elevating the importance of awareness and risk management strategies (Ghafir et al., 2018).

These observations have contributed to the emergence of the interdisciplinary field of social cybersecurity, which integrates computational social science, psychology, and machine learning to analyze and mitigate manipulation at scale (Mulahuwaish et al., 2025). This perspective reframes social engineering as a systemic threat to organizational trust and communication rather than as isolated user failure.

#### 4.2.5 Social Engineering Attack Lifecycle Models

Several studies converge on lifecycle-based models that describe social engineering as a staged process rather than a singular event. A widely cited synthesis identifies four recurring phases: (1) reconnaissance and information gathering, (2) rapport and trust development, (3) exploitation of trust to elicit information or actions, and (4) operationalization of acquired access or data (Ghafir et al., 2018).

This staged progression highlights multiple intervention points beyond the final exploitation phase. Early detection of reconnaissance behavior, anomalous communication patterns, or boundary-testing interactions can disrupt attacks before material harm occurs. Accordingly, the literature emphasizes that effective mitigation requires coordinated technical, behavioral, and organizational controls rather than reliance on end-user vigilance alone.

#### 4.2.6 Synthesis

The reviewed evidence establishes social engineering susceptibility as a predictable outcome of human cognition operating within constrained organizational environments. Attack success is driven not by ignorance alone, but by the interaction of cognitive biases, personality traits, organizational norms, and adaptive attacker strategies. These findings reinforce the need to reconceptualize social engineering defense as a continuous, human-centric process embedded within organizational culture and system design, rather than as a one-time training or awareness problem.

### 4.3. Insider Threats

Threats originating from individuals within the organization (employees, contractors, or other insiders) pose persistent and significant risks because such actors already possess legitimate access to systems and data. Research consistently emphasizes that insider threats are multifaceted, encompassing both **unintentional** and **intentional** behaviors that compromise security (Georgiadou et al., 2021; Zangana et al., 2025). Contemporary studies distinguish between malicious insiders, negligent insiders, and accidental insiders, underscoring that insider incidents are often shaped by psychological, organizational, and cultural variables rather than purely technical failures (Corradini, 2020; Triplett, 2022). A widely used framework, adapted from the Software Engineering Institute's **CERT** taxonomy, categorizes incorrect or unsafe security actions into several types: (1) **Slips** (skill-based errors), which are incorrect actions in routine tasks that require only occasional conscious checks, related to attentional failures; (2) **Lapses** (skill-based errors), which are memory failures in security-relevant actions, such as omitting a planned action or forgetting security intentions; (3) **Rule-based mistakes**, which involve the application of bad rules or inappropriate application of good rules relevant for security; (4) **Knowledge-based mistakes**, which are intentional acts involving faulty conceptual knowledge, incomplete knowledge, or incorrect action specification leading to unwanted policy violations; (5) **Violations** (no malicious intent), which are intentional deviations from security policies or procedures due to underestimation of security consequences, which can be either routine or exceptional; and (6) **Malicious violations**, which are deliberate deviations from security policies or procedures for the purpose of sabotaging the system (Georgiadou et al., 2021; Pollini et al., 2021).

Based on this taxonomy, insider threats can be broadly categorized as:

- **Accidental Insiders:** Accidental insiders are individuals who unintentionally cause security breaches through human error or inattention. Such incidents often arise from routine work practices performed under time pressure, stress, or cognitive overload (Khadka & Ullah, 2025; Zangana et al., 2025). Examples include sending confidential data to the wrong recipient, mishandling credentials, or ignoring warnings due to habituation. These behaviors typically stem not from malice but from limited awareness, inadequate training, and organizational conditions that encourage productivity over compliance (Corradini, 2020). Studies show that improving security culture and reinforcing communication between management and staff significantly reduce these occurrences (Georgiadou et al., 2021; Triplett, 2022).
- **Negligent Insiders:** Negligent insiders intentionally disregard security policies or procedures but without the intent to cause harm. Violations are often motivated by convenience, perceived workarounds, or a misjudged cost-benefit analysis between task efficiency and adherence to rules (Pollini et al., 2021). Negligence may also arise from "security fatigue" or cognitive exhaustion, where employees recognize security requirements but fail to follow them consistently (Khadka & Ullah, 2025). Organizational factors-weak leadership emphasis on cybersecurity, unclear accountability, and insufficient reinforcement of positive behavior-magnify this risk (Corradini, 2020; Triplett, 2022).
- **Malicious Insiders:** Malicious insiders deliberately exploit their access privileges to inflict harm, motivated by revenge, financial gain, or ideological or coercive pressures (Georgiadou et al., 2021; Zangana et al., 2025). These actors often exhibit distinct psychological and situational precursors such as grievance formation, perceived injustice, or disengagement from the organization. Detection and prevention require an integration of **technical controls** (e.g., activity monitoring, anomaly detection) and **behavioral analytics** that track deviations in sentiment, communication, or access behavior (Khadka & Ullah, 2025). Evidence indicates that a strong cybersecurity culture-characterized by open communication, supportive leadership, and employee engagement-can mitigate both the likelihood and the impact of such threats (Corradini, 2020; Triplett, 2022).

Insider threats therefore represent an evolving socio-technical problem that cannot be resolved through technology alone. As emphasized by recent frameworks, effective mitigation depends on aligning individual behavior, organizational culture, and leadership commitment within a coherent security-culture ecosystem (Georgiadou et al., 2021; Khadka & Ullah, 2025; Zangana et al., 2025).

#### 4.3.1 Progression of an Insider Threat

Insider incidents rarely occur spontaneously; rather, they evolve through recognizable stages that provide opportunities for early detection and intervention. Building on the progression model proposed by Cappelli et al., 2012, subsequent studies demonstrate that the insider-threat pathway is dynamic, shaped by human, organizational, and cultural factors (Georgiadou et al., 2021; Hadlington, 2018; Khadka & Ullah, 2025; Zangana et al., 2025). These studies highlight that both malicious and unintentional insiders exhibit gradual behavioral and attitudinal shifts influenced by stress, disengagement, and perceived injustice within their work environment (Corradini, 2020; Triplett, 2022).

Synthesizing findings across these investigations, insider threat development can be described through six overlapping phases:

- **Grievance and Ideation:** Personal or professional grievances emerge, often triggered by perceived unfair treatment, workload stress, or lack of recognition. Early warning indicators include withdrawal, frustration, and declining organizational identification (Triplett, 2022; Zangana et al., 2025).
- **Preparation:** The individual begins to conceptualize possible actions, seeking information or resources that might facilitate the intended behavior. Empirical analyses reveal that access privilege familiarity and perceived managerial indifference increase risk at this stage (Georgiadou et al., 2021).
- **Exploration:** The insider tests boundaries-probing system defenses or policy enforcement-to gauge potential detection. Behavioral cues such as curiosity-driven violations or data snooping often precede escalation (Hadlington, 2018; Khadka & Ullah, 2025).
- **Experimentation:** Minor security violations occur, frequently rationalized as necessary to complete work efficiently. These low-level breaches represent a critical intervention point where organizational culture and peer accountability can deter further action (Corradini, 2020; Zangana et al., 2025).
- **Execution:** The insider carries out the harmful act-data exfiltration, sabotage, or fraud-enabled by insider knowledge and prior testing of controls (Georgiadou et al., 2021).
- **Evasion and Aftermath:** Following the act, individuals may attempt to conceal evidence or justify their behavior. Studies report that rationalization and normalization of deviance are common, reflecting deeper cultural or psychological dissonance (Khadka & Ullah, 2025; Triplett, 2022).

This synthesis indicates that insider-threat progression is not strictly linear but iterative, affected by psychological resilience, organizational stressors, and cultural maturity. Research consistently shows that fostering a strong cybersecurity culture, clear communication, and supportive leadership can interrupt this cycle before escalation (Corradini, 2020; Georgiadou et al., 2021; Zangana et al., 2025).

### 4.4. Organizational Factors

The organizational context serves as the environment in which individual behaviors are either mitigated or exacerbated. Rather than viewing security as a purely technical challenge, the literature identifies four critical organizational pillars that shape human-related risk.

- **Pillar 1: Leadership Commitment and the Cultural Paradigm**

The shared values and norms of an organization-its security climate-heavily dictate employee compliance (da Veiga & Eloff, 2010). However, research highlights a "Compliance Paradox" where a strong culture does not always guarantee rule-following behavior (Pollini et al., 2021). Central to resolving this is management buy-in. (Siew et al., 2025) note that in many SMEs, leadership often prioritizes revenue-generating automation over security, leading to a "culture of complacency" where employees may openly share passwords or neglect device security. To counter this, frameworks now assess "cultural maturity" across dimensions like accountability and management commitment, moving away from simple audit-driven metrics (Dornheim & Zarnekow, 2023; Georgiadou et al., 2020).

- **Pillar 2: The Socio-Technical Design of Policies and Ceremonies**

Security failures often stem from "Democratic" security design-systems that allow too much human error-or "Dictatorial" designs that frustrate users into finding workarounds (Bella, 2021). The literature argues for an "Invisible" or "Beautiful" city approach, where security is a seamless, positive user experience (security-by-design). Policies must avoid "rule conflicts," where employees are forced to choose between security protocols and operational productivity (Pollini et al., 2021). Effective management requires simplifying these procedures and shifting from rigid expectations to viewing procedures as adaptable resources for action(Colabianchi et al., 2025).

- **Pillar 3: Cognitive Load, Stress, and Workforce Resilience**

Organizational stressors, such as high workloads and burnout, are direct precursors to security lapses. (Ajufo & Qutieshat, 2023) highlight that cybercriminals actively exploit "security fatigue," particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic when cognitive resources are depleted. This is not only a general staff issue but a critical problem within Security Operations Centers (SOCs). SOC analysts face massive volumes of false positives and a lack of automation, leading to "alert fatigue" where real threats may be ignored (Chamkar et al., 2022). Addressing this requires a shift toward "Human Factors Security Engineering" (HFSE), treating stress and fatigue as operational risks that require human-centric countermeasures rather than just technical patches (Robinson, 2023).

- **Pillar 4: Strategic Education and Collective Responsibility**

Modern training must move beyond one-off sessions to continuous, multi-modal, and context-aware interventions (Abawajy, 2014; Ghafir et al., 2018). Furthermore, security responsibility is increasingly viewed as an ecosystem. Supply chain cybersecurity highlights that a single partner's cultural weakness can compromise the entire network (Creazza et al., 2022). To manage this, (Colabianchi et al., 2025) propose a roadmap of 16 managerial actions-ranging from reward systems to peer learning-that transition the human element from a "weakest link" to an active component of organizational resilience.

In summary, the literature suggests that organizational factors do not operate in isolation; rather, they form a complex socio-technical web where leadership commitment (Pillar 1) provides the necessary resources for effective policy design (Pillar 2), which in turn determines the cognitive burden placed on the individual (Pillar 3). The shift toward human-centric cybersecurity (Pillar 4) reflects a growing consensus that technical controls are only as effective as the organizational context in which they are deployed. By transitioning from a reactive, "blame-the-user" culture to a proactive, human-factors engineering approach, organizations can move beyond mere compliance toward genuine cyber resilience. This systemic perspective highlights the necessity of aligning internal management strategies with the broader socio-technical realities of the modern threat landscape.

### 4.5. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Usability Factors

The effectiveness of any technical security control is fundamentally capped by its usability. In the socio-technical landscape of cybersecurity, HCI factors determine whether a security tool is an asset or a friction point that induces non-compliant behavior.

- **The Productivity-Security Trade-off:** Security controls perceived as cumbersome or disruptive to primary work tasks are primary drivers of "shadow security"-the practice of users creating workarounds to maintain productivity (Adams Anne  and Sasse, 2021). Common examples include postponing critical system updates to avoid downtime or bypasses in multi-factor authentication (MFA) to save time (Bada & Nurse, 2019; Ergen et al., 2021). When users encounter high interaction costs, they instinctively follow the path of least resistance, favoring ease of use over robust protection.
- **Security Fatigue and Cognitive Overload:** The cumulative burden of constant security demands-ranging from complex password rotations to frequent warning prompts-leads to "security fatigue." This psychological state, characterized by weariness and a sense of being overwhelmed, causes individuals to become less vigilant and more likely to ignore security signals altogether (Bada & Nurse, 2019; Ergen et al., 2021).
- **Interface Communication and Warning Efficacy:** Poorly designed security interfaces often fail to communicate risk effectively. (Moallem, 2021) notes that ambiguous warning messages or "alert bombardment" can lead to "habituation," where users reflexively dismiss warnings without processing the content. Conversely, user-friendly, intuitive designs-ideally developed through co-design methodologies-can significantly reduce accidental errors and foster intrinsic compliance.

### 4.6. Synthesis of Thematic Interdependencies

A critical finding of this thematic analysis is that the human factor cannot be understood through isolated variables; rather, it is a product of interconnected layers. The organizational culture (Section 4.4) dictates the priority given to usability in tool procurement (Section 4.5), which in turn shapes the daily habits and stress levels of the individual (Section 4.1). For instance, a weak organizational security culture often manifests as inadequate training, which elevates susceptibility to social engineering (Section 4.2). Similarly, a system with poor usability does not just cause "human error", it actively incentivizes the "careless" or "risk-seeking" profiles identified in behavioral research. Understanding these cross-thematic links is essential for moving beyond "blame-centric" security toward a resilient, integrative framework.

## 5\. Discussion

While the preceding results draw exclusively from peer-reviewed studies, industry analyses (e.g., (IBM Security, 2023; Verizon, 2023; WEF, 2022) provide complementary insights into how these patterns manifest in practice". The thematic analysis underscores that cybersecurity is fundamentally a socio-technical challenge, where human behavior, cognition, and organizational context are as critical as technical defenses. Despite research indicating that 95% of all cyber incidents are human-enabled (Nobles, 2018), and that 80-90% of security breaches are due to human-enabled errors (Nobles, 2018), organizations continue to invest disproportionately in technological solutions rather than addressing human factors comprehensively. Research has shown that corporate executives, managers, and cybersecurity professionals rely extensively on technology to avert cybersecurity incidents, often fallaciously believing that technology is the key to improving security defenses, even though research indicates that new technologies create unintended consequences and that technology-induced errors are themselves human-enabled (Nobles, 2018). This technological determinism approach is problematic, as most organizations associate human factors issues solely as a training problem, when in reality, the management of complex cybersecurity operations accompanied by mounting human factor challenges exceeds the expertise of most information security professionals and requires the expertise of human factors specialists, cognitive scientists, and behavioral analysts (Nobles, 2018). However, managers are often reluctant to seek such expertise, resulting in a narrow scope of understanding human factors in information security.

### 5.1. Synthesis of Key Findings

The review confirms that human error remains a primary contributor to security incidents, ranging from simple mistakes like data mishandling and misconfiguration to neglecting essential practices like software patching (Verizon, 2023). This is driven by a complex interplay of cognitive biases, psychological states, and a wide array of specific behavioral tendencies and perceptions, including procrastination and future thinking (Coventry et al., 2014; Egelman & Peer, 2015; Moustafa et al., 2021), as well as factors such as the desire for constant connectivity, preference for convenience over security, perceived high costs of security, and social etiquette barriers (Coventry et al., 2014). The persistent issue of inadequate security awareness and training are closely linked. Explicitly, despite adequate cyber threat awareness and knowledge among internet users, they often apply only minimal and simple protective measures, highlighting a significant discrepancy between awareness/knowledge and actual behavior. This gap is evident in behaviors like using the same password for multiple applications or not performing computer security audits, even when aware of risks (Zwilling et al., 2022). While organizations invest in training, its effectiveness is often questionable, with generic programs failing to translate into sustained secure behaviors (Huang & Pearlson, 2019). This highlights a critical disconnect between training delivery and actual behavioral change. Research on delivery methods reveals that the choice of delivery mechanism is a critical success factor, with evidence suggesting that combined delivery methods (text-based, video-based, and game-based) are more effective than individual approaches, and that different methods may be optimal for different types of security awareness content (Abawajy, 2014).

Social engineering susceptibility continues to be a highly effective attack vector, exploiting inherent human trust and cognitive biases. The prevalence of phishing and its variants demonstrates that attackers actively target human psychology, often bypassing technical controls (Anti-Phishing Working Group, 2024). The consistent mention of social engineering, phishing, credential theft, and insider threats across multiple reports (Verizon, Kaspersky, Proofpoint) indicates that human vulnerabilities are not just a static problem but a dynamic attack surface that adversaries continuously adapt to exploit. The rise of AI in crafting more sophisticated phishing or the shift to telephone-oriented attacks demonstrates attackers' agility in targeting human psychology. This implies that cybersecurity strategies must move beyond one-off training to continuous, adaptive security awareness programs that reflect evolving attack methodologies. The "human firewall" requires constant reinforcement and updating, much like technical defenses.

Furthermore, insider threats, both negligent and malicious, represent a complex challenge, leveraging legitimate access privileges, and notably follow a discernible progression from ideation to action, which offers multiple points for detection and intervention. Mitigating these requires not only technical monitoring but also addressing psychological motivations and organizational factors (Nurse et al., 2014).

The review strongly emphasizes the influence of the organizational context. A weak security culture, lack of management support, and poorly designed policies create environments where human vulnerabilities are more likely to manifest. Finally, HCI and usability factors were identified as crucial; poorly designed security tools directly cause user frustration, workarounds, and errors, actively undermining security goals (Sutcliffe & Gault, 2004). This is often due to the "security-usability tradeoff," where the desire for convenience often leads users to choose the path of least resistance over more secure but more effortful options (Bada & Nurse, 2019; Ergen et al., 2021). Proofpoint's observation that "Managers, directors and executives" account for a "far greater attack risk" despite being a small percentage of the workforce, points to a critical area of human-related risk (Proofpoint, 2025). This is not just about general human susceptibility but about the impact of a successful attack on specific individuals. Compromising a Very Attacked Person (VAP) can lead to significantly higher losses due to their access to sensitive data or systems. This suggests that organizations need to prioritize and tailor security awareness and controls for high-value targets within their structure. A blanket approach to human risk mitigation is insufficient; a risk-based, role-specific strategy is essential to protect critical assets.

These findings collectively paint a picture where individual vulnerabilities are often amplified or mitigated by the surrounding organizational and technical environment. The identification of distinct cyber behavior profiles (Cautious unaware, Risk-seekers unaware, Cautious aware, and Risk-seekers aware) further highlights the importance of understanding varied employee responses to cyber threats, moving beyond simplistic attributions of security failures to human error (Przymus et al., 2024). Social influence, particularly the "Social Education Level (SEL)" of an individual's immediate circle (colleagues, friends), can negatively impact cybersecurity knowledge, attitude, and behavior over time. This is a counter-intuitive finding, as senior-level students and working graduates, despite higher education, may exhibit lower Internet Security Awareness (ISA) due to prolonged exposure to environments with lower average SEL (Ergen et al., 2021).

### 5.2. Analysis of Existing Frameworks

The following framework was developed through an interpretive thematic synthesis of the 112 peer-reviewed studies included in this review. Consistent with PRISMA 2020 guidance for systematic literature reviews, conceptual integration is presented within the Discussion to consolidate cross-study insights rather than to report new empirical data. The framework therefore functions as an analytical synthesis of patterns identified in Section 3, organizing the interrelations among individual, organizational, and socio-technical factors into a coherent explanatory structure that informs future research and practice. The literature review considered five existing frameworks often referenced in cybersecurity, evaluating their applicability to addressing human factors based on the synthesized findings. Both the NIST CSF and ISO/IEC 27001 function primarily as governance frameworks that set strategic structures for managing risk rather than prescriptive manuals for implementation; therefore, the discussion here focuses on gaps in translating these frameworks into actionable, human-centered practices rather than on deficiencies in the frameworks themselves. Accordingly, the following section examines these frameworks in relation to human factors in cybersecurity:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF):** While widely adopted for risk management, the latest version, CSF 2.0, provides high-level guidance but offers limited specific detail on _how_ to address human factors comprehensively (National Institute of Standards & Technology, 2024). It acknowledges awareness and training but lacks depth regarding cognitive biases, usability integration, or fostering security culture, a limitation noted in academic critiques (Hutchinson Benjamin  and Nurse, 2023; Renaud & Dupuis, 2021).
- **ISO/IEC 27001:** This standard focuses on establishing, implementing, and continually improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS) (_ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection - Information Security Management Systems - Requirements_, 2022). It includes clauses related to human resource security, but like NIST CSF, it often lacks granular guidance on behavioral aspects and the nuances of human error, focusing more on compliance and governance than on practical human-centric management (von Solms & von Solms, 2018).
- **Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS):** Adapted from aviation safety, HFACS provides a structured way to analyze past incidents and identify human errors across different systemic levels (unsafe acts, preconditions, unsafe supervision, organizational influences) (Wiegmann & Shappell, 2003)**.** HFACS is instrumental in diagnosing both individual and organizational factors that contribute to cybersecurity incidents, focusing on the systemic weaknesses that allow breaches to occur when multiple control layers fail. This model emphasizes a blame-free approach, fostering a culture of two-way communication and awareness within organizations, which is essential for effective cybersecurity practices. By analyzing historical data, HFACS identifies trends and areas that require intervention, aiming to reduce the frequency of security incidents. This holistic approach involves assessing operator preconditions, environmental factors, unsafe supervision, and organizational influences, which together create a more resilient cybersecurity posture. While valuable for incident analysis (reactive), it is less inherently designed as a proactive framework for preventing vulnerabilities, a challenge acknowledged in subsequent research (Patterson & Shappell, 2010).
- **Other Models (e.g., Reason's Swiss Cheese, CREAM):** These models offer conceptual understanding of system failures (e.g., multiple barrier failures, cognitive reliability) but are not comprehensive cybersecurity frameworks. The **Swiss Cheese Model** illustrates that incidents occur when no layer of defense prevents a hazard, highlighting the importance of robust barriers across the cybersecurity framework. They do not address the specific range of human factors identified in this review, such as social engineering susceptibility or organizational culture.

Table 4: Frameworks analysis

| _Framework_ | _Primary Focus_ | _Strengths for Human Factors_ | _Identified Gaps / Limitations_ |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **_NIST CSF 2.0_** | Risk Management; high-level functions (Identify, Protect, etc.). | Acknowledges "Awareness and Training" as a core category. | Lacks specific guidance on cognitive biases, usability, or fostering culture. (National Institute of Standards & Technology, 2024; Renaud & Dupuis, 2021) |
| **_ISO/IEC 27001:2022_** | Establishing a formal Information Security Management System (ISMS). | Includes clauses for human resource security (roles, responsibilities, awareness). | Primarily governance-focused; it offers limited practical guidance on behavioral or psychological aspects. (_ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Information Security, Cybersecurity and Privacy Protection - Information Security Management Systems - Requirements_, 2022; von Solms & von Solms, 2018b) |
| **_HFACS_** | Reactive incident analysis; adapted from aviation safety. | Provides a structured model for tracing errors back to systemic organizational failures. | Primarily a reactive tool for post-incident analysis, not proactive vulnerability prevention. (Patterson & Shappell, 2010b; Wiegmann & Shappell, 2003) |

A key limitation identified across many established frameworks is their insufficient integration of deep psychological principles and socio-technical dynamics. They often treat the "human element" as a component to be managed through policy and training, rather than a complex, integral part of the system. While frameworks focusing specifically on security culture exist, many lack empirical validation and their effectiveness across diverse contexts requires further investigation (Eslami et al., 2019). This placement within the Discussion reflects its role as a synthesis of evidence rather than an additional empirical result, aligning with systematic review conventions that present integrative frameworks as interpretive outcomes.

### 5.3. Identified Research Gaps and Methodological Observations

#### ****5.3.1 Overview of Current Research Gaps****

While the literature on human factors in cybersecurity is extensive, this review identifies several critical deficiencies that hinder the development of a unified security paradigm. These gaps are synthesized into four primary dimensions:

- **Methodological Fragmentation and the Diagnostic Crisis**

A primary barrier to progress is the lack of standardized, validated measurement tools that can be applied across diverse contexts. While instruments such as the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q) have shown promise in predicting phishing performance (Parsons et al., 2017), many existing Information Security Awareness (ISA) scales suffer from poor methodological rigor, often neglecting pilot testing or robust factor analysis (Rohan et al., 2023). This fragmentation extends to industry reporting; a review of five major 2024 reports (including Verizon DBIR and ENISA) reveals significant inconsistencies in how "human error" is classified, with many sources failing to trace active errors back to systemic "latent conditions" like poor interface design (Grandhi & Still, 2025). Furthermore, existing frameworks-though numbering at least 48-remain largely theoretical and difficult for practitioners to implement in real-world settings (Dornheim & Zarnekow, 2023).

- **The "Theory-to-Practice" and Behavioral Sustainability Gap**

There is a profound disconnect between security education and sustained behavior change. Most interventions focus on one-off awareness campaigns, yet there is a critical scarcity of longitudinal studies investigating whether these lead to long-term habits (Khadka & Ullah, 2025). Furthermore, the literature lacks rigorous empirical evaluation of novel mitigation strategies, such as polymorphic warnings or reward/penalty systems (Moustafa et al., 2021; van Steen et al., 2020). This gap is complicated by unresolved discrepancies regarding personality; for instance, it remains unclear why certain traits like conscientiousness sometimes act as a protective factor and other times increase susceptibility to specific social engineering tactics (Hadlington, 2017).

- **Neglected Stakeholders and Socio-Technical Complexity**

The current research landscape is heavily skewed toward "end-users," leaving a significant gap regarding the human factors that affect security professionals, developers, and administrators. The errors made by these "expert users"-often driven by extreme cognitive load and burnout-carry disproportionate risks for the organization (Skopik & Pahi, 2020). Moreover, research remains siloed; factors like phishing awareness are often studied in isolation rather than as part of a complex interplay between organizational culture, individual psychology, and technological design (Cooke & Champion, 2017). This necessitates a shift toward holistic models, such as ecological systems theory, which views cybersecurity as a multi-layered environment ranging from the immediate "microsystem" of the user to the "macrosystem" of broader cultural norms (Mohammad et al., 2022).

- **The Interdisciplinary and Technological Frontier**

There is a notable absence of interdisciplinary cooperation in the technology industry, resulting in products that fail to account for users' emotional and cognitive demands (Al-Badayneh et al., 2025). The field has been slow to integrate criminological frameworks-such as social learning or routine activities theory-which could offer deeper insights into the motivations behind both insider threats and external attacks (Maalem Lahcen et al., 2020). Finally, a nascent but urgent gap exists in the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs). Current assessment frameworks, such as OllaBench, suggest that while LLMs show potential for modeling human networks, they currently lack the consistency and cognitive reasoning required to effectively address human-centric interdependent cybersecurity (Nguyen, 2024).

These thematic gaps collectively suggest that the human factor in cybersecurity is currently hindered by a "maturity ceiling," where the high volume of research has not yet translated into standardized, actionable, or sustainable industry practices. The lack of interdisciplinary integration and the focus on end-user "errors" rather than systemic "latent conditions" highlights a fundamental need for a paradigm shift in how human-centric security is conceptualized. However, understanding these thematic deficiencies is only part of the challenge; it is equally necessary to examine the underlying research methodologies that have led to these gaps. The following section, therefore, provides a critical observation of the methodological limitations-ranging from sampling biases to a lack of longitudinal rigor-that characterize the current body of literature.

#### 5.3.2 Methodological Limitations and Observations

Despite significant advances, the methodological rigor of existing studies on human factors in cybersecurity remains uneven. Much of the literature relies on cross-sectional survey designs and simulated environments that limit ecological validity (Johnston et al., 2017). Qualitative approaches provide valuable depth but often suffer from small samples and limited generalizability, while quantitative studies rarely incorporate behavioral or longitudinal data capable of capturing change over time. Cultural and geographical bias persists, with Western contexts dominating published research and few comparative analyses across sectors or national settings. The lack of standardized measurement instruments and consistent theoretical frameworks further constrains comparability across studies, underscoring the need for methodological diversification, mixed-methods designs, and replication studies.

#### 5.3.3 Theoretical Implications

Beyond identifying empirical and methodological gaps, this review contributes theoretically by integrating insights from psychology, organizational behavior, human factors engineering, and socio-technical systems research into a coherent framework for understanding cybersecurity behavior. Existing studies tend to isolate single dimensions of the human factor-individual cognition, organizational culture, or technological usability-without articulating their interdependence. By synthesizing these fragmented perspectives, the present review reconceptualizes human factors as a multi-level, dynamic construct that mediates between individual, organizational, and technological systems.

This integration advances theory in two ways. First, it extends behavioral cybersecurity research by positioning human factors not merely as antecedents of non-compliance but as adaptive mechanisms shaping resilience and organizational learning. Second, it bridges psychological and socio-technical approaches, suggesting that effective cybersecurity models must account for feedback loops between user behavior, cultural context, and technical design.

Future research should empirically test this integrative framework across diverse sectors and cultures, operationalizing its constructs through longitudinal and cross-disciplinary designs. Such work can refine theoretical understanding of how human, organizational, and technological variables interact over time to influence cybersecurity outcomes and resilience.

### 5.4. Cross-cutting Patterns and Contextual Influences

The systematic analysis of the literature reveals that human factors do not function in a vacuum; they are governed by cross-cutting patterns that bridge individual behavior with broader environmental contexts, the patterns include:

- **Technological Evolution and the Resilience Paradox**

As digital environments evolve, so too do the human-centric vulnerabilities they introduce. The rise of immersive technologies like the **Metaverse** presents a unique challenge, requiring specialized behavioral skills for virtual reality environments, such as managing virtual-identity security and updates for immersive applications (Al-Emran & Deveci, 2024).

Furthermore, the role of **Artificial Intelligence** represents a significant paradox in the current landscape. While AI enables sophisticated "low-effort" phishing, error-free social engineering, and deepfakes, it also provides defenders with the tools to personalize training and detect subtle behavioral anomalies. This shift necessitates a move away from static security controls toward adaptive, AI-enhanced defenses that learn from and support human decision-making. However, human resilience remains the ultimate fallback; during "black swan" events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, cybercriminals successfully exploited the fear and stress of individuals, proving that technological advancements cannot fully compensate for psychological vulnerabilities (Kadena & Gupi, 2021).

- **Educational and Developmental Influences**

A consistent pattern emerged regarding the role of formal education and professional background. Notably, cybersecurity awareness is not always linear; research in school contexts suggests a "regression" effect, where younger students (6th grade) often exhibit better digital citizenship and awareness than their older counterparts (9th grade), highlighting a need for continuous, age-appropriate reinforcement (Antunes et al., 2021).

In higher education, a clear discrepancy exists based on the field of study. Computer Science (CS) students consistently demonstrate superior security habits-such as password hygiene-compared to Media Studies (MS) students, likely due to their deeper technical grounding in system architecture (Huraj et al., 2023). However, this also suggests that non-technical students may possess overlooked strengths in understanding the social and ethical implications of technology. Additionally, the **Social Education Level (SEL)** of a user's environment acts as a quantifiable influence; exposure to environments with lower average security awareness (such as entering full-time work) can actually lead to the deterioration of an individual's established security habits over time (Ergen et al., 2021).

- **Socio-Cultural and National Dynamics**

Contextual influences extend beyond education into industry and national culture. Different sectors face unique behavioral hurdles; for example, healthcare professionals must navigate the "clinical-security trade-off," balancing the urgency of patient care with the stringent requirements of sensitive data protection (Nifakos et al., 2021).

On a global scale, National Culture significantly dictates risk perception and the "outsourcing" of responsibility. In technologically sophisticated nations like Israel, high confidence in national infrastructure can paradoxically lead to less cautious personal behavior. In contrast, in developing cybersecurity landscapes like Turkey, awareness is more directly tied to individual implementation (Zwilling et al., 2022). Applying Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions further elucidates these differences. For instance, power distance and collectivism promote a centralized, authority-led approach to security, while high uncertainty avoidance drives a preference for established, validated technologies over novel solutions (Shah et al., 2023). These cultural nuances-alongside regional factors like the Internet gender gap and local regulations-emphasize that a "one-size-fits-all" global security strategy is fundamentally insufficient.

The cross-cutting patterns analyzed in this section-ranging from the psychological impact of emerging technologies to the deep-seated influence of national culture-underscore the reality that human-centric cybersecurity is not a static problem. Rather, it is a dynamic, socio-technical challenge where individual, organizational, and cultural variables are in constant flux. The findings suggest that existing mitigation strategies often fail because they are too narrow, focusing either on technical controls or basic awareness while ignoring the broader contextual and developmental influences identified in this review. To address these systemic gaps and the "maturity ceiling" currently facing the field, a more integrative and adaptive model is required. Consequently, the following section proposes a novel framework designed to synthesize these diverse factors into a cohesive, actionable strategy for enhancing organizational resilience against human-driven cyber threats.

## 6\. Proposed Novel Framework Components

Addressing the limitations of existing models and the gaps identified in the literature requires a framework that is more integrated, context-aware, and explicitly incorporates psychological and socio-technical dimensions. Such an approach moves beyond isolated factors to model the complex interactions within the entire system (Cooke & Champion, 2017)**.** Based on the findings of this review, we propose the following components as foundational elements for such a novel framework:

### 6.1. Individual Psychological Factors Core

This component moves beyond basic awareness to delve into the cognitive and psychological underpinnings of security behavior. It is crucial to understand the psychological factors that affect employee behavior to develop effective cybersecurity training programs. It would involve assessing and understanding:

- **Cognitive Biases:** Systematically identifying prevalent biases (e.g., optimism, confirmation, availability) within the user population and their potential impact on security decisions and threat perception (McCormac et al., 2017). Training programs should concentrate on critical areas such as cognitive biases, integrating neuroscience and cognitive psychology principles to better prepare employees for real-world cyber threats.
- **Risk Perception and Mental Models:** Evaluating how individuals perceive cybersecurity risks and their mental models of how security systems work (or fail), as these models dictate their interactions with security controls (Corradini, 2020)**.**
- **Motivation and Attitudes:** Assessing intrinsic and extrinsic motivations related to security compliance, attitudes towards policies, and perceived self-efficacy, which are known to influence compliance intentions (Bulgurcu et al., 2010).
- **Individual Differences:** Considering relevant personality traits (e.g., conscientiousness, risk aversion) where evidence suggests they significantly impact security behavior, such as susceptibility to social engineering (Egelman & Peer, 2015)**.**
- **Stress, Fatigue, and Cognitive Load:** Evaluating the impact of workplace stressors and cognitive load on decision-making, error rates, and vigilance (Ferguson-Walter et al., 2021). Training programs should also focus on stress management and decision-making under pressure. It is also important to address issues like security fatigue. The framework's assessment of individual psychological factors should also include identifying which of the distinct cyber behavior profiles (Cautious unaware, Risk-seekers unaware, Cautious aware, and Risk-seekers aware) an individual falls into, to enable more precise interventions (Przymus et al., 2024).

### 6.2. Behavioral Response and Compliance Module

This component focuses on observable actions and adherence to security protocols, linking psychological factors to tangible behaviors. Key areas include:

- **Security Protocol Adherence:** Measuring compliance with specific policies (e.g., password complexity, data handling, acceptable use).
- **Security Hygiene Practices:** Assessing routine behaviors like locking screens, updating software, and using secure networks.
- **Incident Reporting Behavior:** Evaluating the willingness and ability of users to recognize and report suspicious activities, which is critical for early detection and is heavily influenced by organizational factors (Blythe et al., 2013)**.**
- **Workaround Behaviors:** Identifying instances where users bypass security controls and understanding the underlying reasons, which are often linked to usability and perceived inefficiency (the security-usability tradeoff) (Nobles et al., 2025).

### 6.3. Socio-Organizational Context Layer

This component explicitly integrates the influence of the organizational environment on individual and group security behavior. It includes:

- **Security Culture Assessment:** Utilizing validated methods to measure the prevailing security culture, including shared values, norms, beliefs, and management attitudes towards security (da Veiga & Eloff, 2010)**.**
- **Leadership Commitment and Communication:** Assessing the visibility, consistency, and effectiveness of leadership messaging and demonstrated commitment to cybersecurity, which is a primary driver of the organizational security climate (Hina & Lowry, 2020).
- **Policy Design and Enforcement:** Evaluating the clarity, practicality, perceived fairness, and consistent enforcement of security policies and procedures.
- **Training and Awareness Program Evaluation:** Assessing the design, delivery, engagement, and, most importantly, the behavioral impact of training initiatives, moving beyond simple knowledge transfer to measure actual behavior change (Kirlappos et al., 2013).

### 6.4. Human-System Interaction (HCI) & Usability Component

Recognizing that technology interaction significantly influences behavior, this component focuses on:

- **Usability of Security Tools:** Evaluating the ease of use, efficiency, and user satisfaction associated with security controls, software, and interfaces (e.g., authentication mechanisms, security warnings, reporting tools).
- **Friction Points and Workflow Integration:** Identifying how security measures impact user workflows and identifying points of friction that might encourage non-compliance or workarounds.
- **User-Centered Security Design Principles:** Providing guidance for designing or selecting security solutions that prioritize usability alongside security effectiveness, following established user-centered design paradigms (Ragone et al., 2024).
- **Design Requirements for Human Error Mitigation:** Enterprises must account for the possibility of vulnerabilities, including human error, in the design of systems (Maalem Lahcen et al., 2020). If insider threats are considered as a design requirement rather than solely a behavioral problem, organizations can mitigate risks by improving the environment and planning human factors considerations into the design of future systems. This approach recognizes that system design may enable insider risk because of existing vulnerabilities or conditions, and that avoiding vulnerabilities in design is much better than trying to patch them or spending resources guarding them. The assumption is that system design can reduce insider risk by addressing environmental and contextual factors that contribute to human error (Maalem Lahcen et al., 2020).

### 6.5. Threat Environment Interaction Module

This component links human vulnerabilities to specific cyber threats:

- **Social Engineering Susceptibility Profiling:** Assessing vulnerability to different social engineering tactics (phishing, pretexting, etc.) using validated models based on psychological factors and awareness levels (Algarni et al., 2016).
- **Insider Threat Risk Factors:** Analyzing factors contributing to both negligent (e.g., carelessness, lack of training) and potentially malicious (e.g., disgruntlement, perceived injustice) insider actions, considering the full typology of motivations (Caputo et al., 2014).
- **Contextual Threat Relevance:** Mapping identified human vulnerabilities to the specific threats most relevant to the organization's context and industry. It is also important to help employees understand threat actors, which empowers them to recognize and counteract potential risks.

### 6.6. Mitigation Strategy and Intervention Design Guidance

This component provides a structured methodology for translating the assessments from previous sections into actionable interventions. Rather than relying on generic awareness campaigns, this guide advocates for a "precision-defense" approach categorized into five strategic pillars.

- **Precision Mapping and Profile-Based Customization**

The first step in intervention design is the abandonment of "one-size-fits-all" training. Interventions must be mapped directly to the user's specific cyber behavior profile-whether Cautious, Careless, Reasonable, or Risk-seeking (Przymus et al., 2024). This mapping should extend to specific cognitive biases; for example, "Experts" who suffer from overconfidence require different psychological reframing than "Repressors" who utilize information avoidance (Aschwanden et al., 2024). By utilizing behavioral psychology theories, organizations can leverage "security nudges" to reframe choices at the point of decision, effectively bridging the gap between knowledge and action (Kahneman, 2011; Williams et al., 2019).

- **Advanced Pedagogical Modalities: Gamification and Simulation**

To combat the rapid decay of training retention-where employees typically lose up to 90% of information within one week-this framework emphasizes multi-modal, interactive delivery (Ghafir et al., 2018).

- - **Serious Gaming:** Organizations should utilize game-based platforms like _PhishGuru_ or _PhishDefend Quest_ to foster engagement through immediate feedback (Desolda et al., 2022; Yasin et al., 2024). While game-based methods are superior for phishing identification, video-based training remains more effective for email-specific detection, necessitating a hybrid approach (Abawajy, 2014).
    - **Immersive Environments:** Virtual "escape rooms" offer a scalable way to foster collaborative learning, though they should be complemented by role-playing simulations to address targeted social engineering (Löffler et al., 2021).
    - **Adaptive Systems:** Frameworks like _ASURA_ (Adaptive SecUrity awaReness trAining) can dynamically update content based on the evolving threat landscape, ensuring that training remains relevant and timely (Tan et al., 2020).

- **Strengthening "Cognitive Shields" and Habit Formation**

Intervention design must differentiate between **active** and **passive** security behaviors. Passive behaviors-such as screen locking or updating software-are conducive to habit formation and should be reinforced through routine integration (Prümmer, 2024). Conversely, active behaviors involving social engineering (e.g., Wi-Fi selection) require conscious processing; building habits for these can be dangerous, as strong email habits can actually increase phishing vulnerability (Prümmer, 2024). To strengthen these "cognitive shields," organizations should implement:

- - **Cognitive Training:** Working memory exercises to reduce impulsivity and procrastination (Moustafa et al., 2021).
    - **Situated Learning:** Real-time tools like dynamic password meters that improve strength awareness during the act of creation (Pratama et al., 2023).
    - **Polymorphic Warnings:** Security alerts that vary in appearance to prevent "habituation," where users reflexively ignore static warnings (Moustafa et al., 2021).

- **System-Level Reliability and User-Centric Modeling  
    **The framework incorporates "Human Reliability" as an essential metric for overall system safety. Just as aviation systems estimate the "cybernetic ability" of a pilot to process information under pressure, cybersecurity systems should structurally correspond to the morphological and physiological features of the human operator (Polishchuk et al., 2022; Ryczyński, 2019). For non-technical environments like SMEs, the use of **Customer Journey Modeling Language (CJML)** can visualize security processes from the user's perspective, making complex threats comprehensible without professional training (Luan et al., 2023).
- **Behavioral Reinforcement and National-Level Literacy**

Finally, the framework utilizes both internal and external reinforcement mechanisms. Internally, decoy-based training (e.g., benign phishing tests) provides immediate feedback and quantitative metrics for comparing departmental resilience (Bowen et al., 2011). This should be coupled with reward and penalty systems-ranging from positive reinforcement for compliance to simulated negative consequences for lapses (Ergen et al., 2021; Moustafa et al., 2021). Externally, organizations should align with national-level cyber literacy campaigns. As human error contributes to 83-84% of all incidents, early education and public institutional support (like libraries) are critical for raising a "cyber-smart" generation capable of navigating the digital world safely (Kont, 2023; Ryczyński, 2019).

### 6.7. Measurement and Evaluation Loop

The final component of the proposed framework establishes a continuous feedback mechanism to ensure that interventions remain effective and adaptive. This loop moves beyond binary "pass/fail" compliance, focusing instead on the holistic maturation of the human-technical system.

- **Definition of Multi-Dimensional Metrics**

Effective evaluation begins with metrics that prioritize behavioral indicators over simple awareness. The framework utilizes "Security Self-Efficacy"-the user's belief in their ability to perform security tasks-as a core predictor of behavior (Herath & Rao, 2009). To standardize this assessment, the framework incorporates validated instruments like the Human Aspects of Information Security Questionnaire (HAIS-Q) (Parsons et al., 2017). By applying the Knowledge-Attitude-Behavior (KAB) model across seven critical domains-including password hygiene, incident reporting, and mobile device usage-organizations can establish a baseline that identifies specific psychological or technical gaps (Parsons et al., 2017).

- **Quantitative Assessment of Organizational Posture**

To measure real-world resilience, the framework advocates for decoy-based "phony phishing" campaigns. These systems provide objective data on user vulnerability, revealing role-based discrepancies (e.g., the higher susceptibility often found in students compared to academic staff). Empirical evidence suggests that these campaigns are most effective when iterated; it may take up to four rounds of testing before users consistently reach a threshold of threat recognition (Bowen et al., 2011). In specialized environments such as Industrial Control Systems (ICS), the loop incorporates the "Human-factored Cyber Security Capability Evaluation." This allows for the quantitative mapping of security skills within the workforce, ensuring that Operational Technology (OT) personnel are evaluated based on their unique operational constraints (Ani et al., 2019).

- **Human-Centric Situational Awareness (SA)**

A critical, often overlooked dimension of the evaluation loop is the measurement of Situational Awareness (SA). Drawing on established principles from aviation and healthcare, the framework assesses SA through three cognitive processes: perception, comprehension, and prediction (Gutzwiller et al., 2020). Measurement focuses on identifying where the defensive chain breaks-whether through perceptual failures (undetected data) or predictive failures (inability to anticipate an attack's trajectory). By monitoring these cognitive states, organizations can manage the "fatigue and cognitive workload" that typically degrades a defender's performance, providing a proactive measure of security health before a breach occurs (Gutzwiller et al., 2020).

- **Iterative Evaluation and User Feedback**

The final stage of the loop involves a program-evaluation approach to verify intervention efficacy (Rossi et al., 2018). This includes:

- - **Behavioral Tracking:** Measuring user engagement with polymorphic warnings and the specific impact of reward or penalty systems on adherence rates.
    - **The Feedback Channel:** Establishing qualitative processes where users can report friction points in policies or tools, ensuring that security measures do not hinder productivity.
    - **Continuous Refinement:** Using collected data to re-map interventions (Section 5.6) and update user profiles (Section 5.1), completing the cycle of the framework.

### 6.8. Interrelationships: A Dynamic Systems Perspective

The true strength of this proposed framework lies not in its individual components, but in their dynamic and systemic interconnections. Unlike linear models that treat human factors as isolated problems to be fixed, this framework operates as an integrated system with continuous feedback loops. The relationships between components are reciprocal, meaning that a change in one area will invariably influence others, allowing for a more holistic and diagnostic approach to managing human-related risk.

We illustrate these multidimensional feedback loops and systemic interdependencies in **Figure 3**, which highlights the following key relationships:

- **The Foundational Top-Down Influence:** The **Socio-Organizational Context (6.3)** acts as the foundational layer that shapes the entire system. Strong leadership commitment, a positive security culture, and clear policies directly influence **Individual Psychological Factors (6.1)** by fostering motivation, positive attitudes, and accurate risk perception among employees. This positive psychological state is a direct antecedent to promoting desired **Security Behaviors & Protocol Compliance (6.2)**, such as consistent security hygiene and proactive incident reporting.
- **The Bottom-Up, Threat-Driven Pathway:** An external stimulus from the **Threat Environment (6.5)**, such as a sophisticated phishing campaign, initiates another critical pathway. This threat directly interacts with an individual's psychological state **(6.1)**, exploiting cognitive biases like urgency or authority. The success of this interaction is often mediated by the **HCI & Usability (6.4)** of the technology involved; for example, a poorly designed email client with ineffective warnings may fail to interrupt the user's biased decision-making. This combination of factors leads to an observable, insecure action captured in the **Security Behavior (6.2)** component, such as clicking a malicious link.
- **The Central Diagnostic and Mitigation Loop:** This is the framework's adaptive core. The insecure behavior **(6.2)** is identified and analyzed through the **Measurement & Evaluation (6.7)** component. Crucially, this component does not simply flag a failure. Instead, it acts as a diagnostic engine, feeding insights back into the system to drive improvement. Based on the evaluation, targeted **Mitigation Strategies (6.6)** are developed-these could be behavioral nudges, simulations, or rewards. Simultaneously, the evaluation provides feedback to other components to address the root cause. For instance:
- If the incident stemmed from a usability flaw, it prompts a review of the tool's design **(6.4)**.
- If the incident reveals a widespread cognitive bias, it informs the psychological assessment and training focus **(6.1)**.
- If employees were afraid to report the mistake, it signals a cultural issue that must be addressed by leadership **(6.3)**.

This integrated, feedback-driven model ensures that interventions are not random but are targeted at the true source of the vulnerability. By mapping these intricate relationships, the framework enables organizations to move beyond a reactive cycle of blame and retraining. It fosters a proactive, adaptive, and systemic strategy that treats the human element as an integral part of the security ecosystem, allowing for the continuous strengthening of the human firewall.

## 7\. Conclusion

We predicated this research on the understanding that cybersecurity is a profound socio-technical challenge, not merely a technological contest. The preceding sections have systematically dismantled the notion that technical controls alone can secure organizational assets, consistently revealing the human element as the central fulcrum of both vulnerability and resilience. This systematic literature review was therefore undertaken to synthesize over a decade of academic research, moving beyond simplistic statistics to explore the complex interplay of psychological, social, and organizational factors that shape human behavior in the face of persistent cyber threats.

This concluding section serves to synthesize the key insights gleaned from this extensive review and articulate their broader significance. It begins by providing a concise summary of the review process and a recap of the most salient findings. Subsequently, the section explores the critical implications of this research for practice, policy, and future academic inquiry, offering actionable recommendations for organizations and researchers alike. After acknowledging the inherent limitations of this study, it looks forward, proposing core components for an integrated framework and outlining vital directions for future investigation to build a more secure and human-aware digital ecosystem.

### 7.1. Summary of the Review

This Systematic Literature Review synthesized and evaluated peer-reviewed academic research published between 2010 and 2025 to comprehensively assess the role of human factors in cybersecurity vulnerabilities within organizational settings. By analyzing literature from key databases using a structured methodology, the review aimed to identify recurring themes, analyze existing frameworks, pinpoint research gaps, and ultimately propose components for a novel framework to better understand and mitigate human-related cybersecurity risks.

### 7.2. Key Findings Recap

The review consistently found that the human element is a critical, often central, factor in the majority of cybersecurity incidents. The figures, whether 74% from Verizon or 95% from the WEF, consistently highlight this reality. The exact percentage, while a point of interest, is less important than the underlying understanding that human actions, vulnerabilities, and psychology are central to the modern threat landscape. The discrepancies in reported percentages largely stem from varying definitions of "human element" or "human error," differing scopes of incidents analyzed (e.g., confirmed breaches vs. all incidents), and distinct methodologies employed by reporting entities. This underscores the critical need for careful interpretation of cybersecurity statistics, emphasizing the importance of understanding the context and methodology behind each figure.

Key findings include the significant impact of individual factors such as unintentional human error**,** inadequate security awareness, and poor password hygiene. Social engineering tactics remain highly effective, successfully exploiting human psychology and cognitive biases (Vishwanath, 2011). Insider threats, both negligent and malicious, pose complex risks rooted in access privileges and human motivations. Crucially, the organizational context-including security culture and leadership commitment-was found to significantly shape individual behaviors (Hina & Lowry, 2020). Furthermore, the usability of security systems emerged as a vital factor, with poor design leading to user frustration, errors, and insecure workarounds. Existing frameworks, while valuable, often lack depth in addressing these psychological, behavioral, and socio-technical nuances.

### 7.3. Implications for Organizations, Government's, and Research

The findings carry significant implications. For organizations, this review underscores the inadequacy of relying solely on technical defenses. A holistic, multi-layered security strategy is imperative, integrating human-centric approaches. This includes investing in continuous, behavior-focused education tailored to roles and risks (Bada et al., 2019) ; actively cultivating a positive security culture championed by leadership; designing or selecting security tools with usability as a core requirement; and implementing clear, practical, and consistently enforced policies.

Awareness campaigns need to move beyond mere information dissemination and incorporate scientifically grounded behavior change techniques to be truly effective. It is also crucial to conduct rigorous effectiveness studies to measure the actual impact of these campaigns on security behaviors (van Steen et al., 2020). As cyber adversaries increasingly leverage advanced techniques, including AI, to exploit human weaknesses, organizations must adopt a dynamic and continuously evolving approach to human-centric security. This involves moving beyond a simplistic view of "human error" to a comprehensive strategy of "human vulnerability management." Strengthening the "human firewall" through ongoing, targeted education, fostering a pervasive culture of security, and the strategic implementation of human-aware technical controls is not merely a best practice-it is a fundamental pillar of cyber resilience in an increasingly interconnected and threat-laden world. Furthermore, the criticality of "detective controls" for human-enabled breaches cannot be overstated. Verizon notes the need for "detective controls" to catch "Internal actor-facilitated attack\[s\] in its early stages".

This is particularly relevant given the rise in collusion. While preventive measures (like training) are crucial, the reality is that human error or malicious intent will sometimes bypass them. Therefore, the ability to quickly detect when a human-related incident is unfolding is paramount to minimizing damage. This includes robust logging, behavioral analytics, and rapid incident response capabilities. Organizations should invest in and regularly test their detective capabilities, focusing on indicators of compromise that often stem from human actions (e.g., unusual login times, access to sensitive data by unauthorized personnel, suspicious email forwarding rules). This proactive detection is key to moving from a reactive to a resilient security posture.

To bridge the gap between awareness/knowledge and actual protective behaviors, organizations should move beyond theoretical knowledge transfer in training to focus on practical, action-oriented workshops and programs (Zwilling et al., 2022). These programs should aim to:

- Increase employee knowledge related to specific cyber security attacks.
- Cultivate new attitudes toward cyber risk and responsibility.
- Translate awareness into action by decreasing human factors resulting in vulnerabilities.
- Develop new rules informing best cyber practices (Zwilling et al., 2022).

It is also important to configure cyber defense tools with organizational architecture to increase employee cybersecurity awareness, rather than relying solely on individual initiative (Zwilling et al., 2022). Organizations need to actively counter negative social influences by fostering a culture where employees are empowered to be "security ambassadors" and by providing continuous, adaptive training that addresses the impact of social norms and peer behavior (Ergen et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023). Strategies should account for the potential deterioration of Internet Security Awareness (ISA) with prolonged work exposure, especially for highly educated individuals entering diverse work environments (Ergen et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2023).

In terms of research, organizations and governments in developed countries that invest heavily in cyber tools should direct more efforts towards educating and increasing awareness among their citizens, as reliance on technological solutions alone may lead to a false sense of security and less cautious individual (Zwilling et al., 2022). There is also a need for culturally sensitive and context-specific awareness programs that account for these national differences in perception and behavior. Organizations should also explore innovative and interactive methods like dynamic password meters to bridge the knowledge-behavior gap in password hygiene (Pratama et al., 2023). Organizations should consider both strong deterrents (like the proposed banning) and proactive cognitive enhancements to foster a truly secure environment. Understanding this progression is crucial for organizations to implement proactive detection and intervention strategies, rather than just reactive measures, allowing for early intervention at various stages of an insider threat's development.

Government involvement is critical in promoting the adoption of human-oriented cybersecurity frameworks. By understanding the psychological factors that influence employee behavior, governments can guide organizations in implementing effective cybersecurity training programs that address these issues. Governments can facilitate this by providing resources and support for organizations to adopt these strategies. Furthermore, addressing the intersection of human factors psychology and cybersecurity, particularly in sensitive sectors like healthcare, underscores the necessity for a scientifically grounded approach to developing training programs. This can help fill the critical gaps in current practices, making government support crucial for promoting a holistic understanding of cybersecurity that encompasses human behavior.

For research, this review highlights several critical needs. There is a pressing need for studies with stronger theoretical foundations, particularly drawing from behavioral sciences (Vance et al., 2012). Methodologically, future research should move towards more objective measures of behavior, employ longitudinal designs to assess the long-term impact of interventions, and utilize mixed-methods approaches for richer insights (Johnston et al., 2017). More research is required to evaluate the effectiveness of specific interventions beyond basic awareness training. Investigations into context-specific factors (industry, culture, size) and the unique vulnerabilities of expert users are also warranted (Schlegel et al., 2022). Filling these gaps requires interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science, psychology, sociology, and organizational behavior researchers.

### 7.4. Proposed Framework and Future Directions

Based on the identified gaps and synthesized findings, this review proposed core components for a novel framework. This framework emphasizes the integration of individual psychological factors, behavioral responses, socio-organizational context, HCI/usability, and threat interactions. Future work should focus on developing, validating, and refining such integrated frameworks through empirical research, as a lack of empirical validation is a key weakness in many existing models (Eslami et al., 2019). Specifically, research should prioritize evaluating the effectiveness of interventions derived from this holistic perspective, exploring the dynamics of security behavior change over time, and developing standardized, yet adaptable, methods for assessing and improving the human element within diverse organizational contexts.

### 7.5. Limitations of the Review

This review employed **qualitative thematic synthesis** rather than a quantitative meta-analysis; therefore, any **publication bias** primarily threatens the **comprehensiveness and balance of the themes** identified, not pooled effect estimates. Limits include: (i) **English-language** publications only; (ii) reliance on **selected databases**, which may miss relevant studies; and (iii) potential **bias toward studies with positive or striking findings surfaced in titles/abstracts**. We mitigated these risks through multi-database searching, explicit criteria, and transparent screening, but some bias may remain.

### 7.6. Final Remarks

The human factor is not merely a component of cybersecurity; it is intrinsic to it. Ignoring or underestimating the complex interplay of human behavior, cognition, and organizational context leaves organizations perpetually vulnerable. Addressing this challenge requires a fundamental shift towards proactive, integrated, and human-centered cybersecurity strategies (Bowers & Sasse, 2021). Continued research and practical application focusing on the human element are not just beneficial but essential for building a more resilient and secure digital future.
