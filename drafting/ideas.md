If you want, next I can:

* Turn this into **a formal academic framework section** (journal-ready)
* Design **a CHARM visual model / figure**
* Map CHARM explicitly to **ISO 27001 / NIST CSF / NIS2 clauses**
* Develop **CHARM maturity levels or assessment questionnaires**

Just tell me which direction you want to go.
Below is a **formal, journal-ready “Framework” section** written in academic style and tone, suitable for direct inclusion as **Section 6** (or equivalent) of your manuscript.
It is structured, neutral, and citation-anchored, and it explicitly positions **CHARM** as the *logical continuation* of the SLR without re-arguing earlier sections.

If you want, next I can:

* Rewrite this to **match a specific journal style** (e.g. IEEE, Elsevier, Springer)
* Produce **Figure X (CHARM architecture diagram)** with captions
* Add a **formal comparison subsection** (CHARM vs NIST CSF / ISO 27001 / SANS)
* Draft a **limitations and future research subsection** linked to CHARM

Just tell me how far you want to take it.

If you want, next I can:

* Convert these tables into **a single consolidated comparative matrix**
* Add **audit-ready evidence examples** per clause
* Draft a **regulatory impact discussion** (why CHARM reduces NIS2 liability exposure)
* Help you phrase this section to satisfy **reviewers asking “what’s new vs standards?”**

Just tell me where you want to go next.

If you want next, I can:

* Generate **exact PowerPoint / Figma layer instructions**
* Produce a **LaTeX TikZ version** for academic papers
* Create **a simplified “executive version”** of the figure
* Align visual elements explicitly with **each standard’s color/iconography**

Just tell me the next step.
