Below is a **conceptual–operational blueprint for CHARM (Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management Framework)**, explicitly designed as a **continuation and operationalisation** of the framework implicitly emerging from your *manuscript* (SLR) and aligned with **ENISA’s behavioural cybersecurity guidance and NIS2 risk-management logic**.

The blueprint deliberately **does not repeat** what your manuscript already establishes (human-factor taxonomy, empirical grounding, gaps), but **extends it into an actionable, modular framework** that organizations can implement, measure, and continuously improve.

---

## 1. Positioning CHARM in Relation to the Manuscript

The manuscript establishes:

* The **human factor as a socio-technical system**, not an isolated weakness
* A **taxonomy of human-related risks** (individual, social, organizational, HCI)
* Clear evidence that **awareness-only approaches fail** to produce sustained behavior change 

**CHARM is the next step**:

* It **translates the SLR findings into a governance-ready framework**
* It integrates **psychological science + organizational controls + risk management**
* It aligns with **NIS2 / ENISA technical and methodological expectations**, without duplicating them 

In short:

> *The manuscript answers “what and why”; CHARM answers “how, where, and with what feedback loop”.*

---

## 2. Design Principles of CHARM

CHARM is built on six explicit principles derived from the reviewed literature and ENISA guidance:

1. **Human-as-Asset, not Human-as-Problem**
   (shift from “weakest link” to “adaptive defense layer”) 

2. **Behavior before Compliance**
   Target *actual behavior in context*, not abstract policy adherence

3. **Risk-Based Personalization**
   Different users → different risk profiles → different interventions

4. **Socio-Technical Integration**
   Behavior, technology usability, and organizational pressure are inseparable

5. **Continuous Measurement & Adaptation**
   No one-off training; continuous sensing, feedback, and refinement

6. **Regulatory & Standards Compatibility**
   CHARM overlays existing frameworks (ISO 27001, NIS2, NIST CSF) rather than competing with them

---

## 3. High-Level Architecture of CHARM

CHARM is structured into **five interlocking layers**, forming a closed feedback loop.

## 6. The CHARM Framework: Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management

### 6.1. Rationale and Conceptual Positioning

The findings of the systematic literature review demonstrate that human-related cybersecurity risk emerges from a complex interaction of cognitive, behavioral, organizational, and socio-technical factors, rather than from isolated user errors. While existing cybersecurity standards and frameworks acknowledge the importance of awareness and training, they typically operationalize the human factor in a fragmented or superficial manner, often defaulting to generic awareness programs and compliance-oriented controls. The reviewed literature further shows that such approaches have limited effectiveness in producing sustained behavioral change and fail to account for contextual and psychological drivers of insecurity .

To address these limitations, this study proposes the **Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management (CHARM) framework**, a human-centric, risk-based framework designed to operationalize the insights derived from the literature into a structured, implementable model. CHARM is conceived not as a replacement for existing cybersecurity frameworks, but as a complementary layer that integrates human factors explicitly into organizational cybersecurity risk management processes. In doing so, it aligns with recent regulatory and policy guidance emphasizing risk-based, outcome-oriented cybersecurity governance, including the European Union’s NIS2 Directive and associated technical guidance .

CHARM builds on socio-technical and behavioral science perspectives, particularly those highlighted in ENISA’s evidence-based reviews of behavioral cybersecurity research, which stress the importance of enabling secure behavior through organizational design, usability, and continuous adaptation rather than relying on threat-based messaging or punitive controls .

---

### 6.2. Design Principles of the CHARM Framework

The design of CHARM is guided by six foundational principles derived from the synthesis of the reviewed literature:

1. **Human-as-Asset Perspective**
   CHARM conceptualizes humans as adaptive security resources whose behavior can enhance organizational resilience when appropriately supported, rather than as inherent vulnerabilities to be controlled.

2. **Behavior-Centered Security**
   The framework prioritizes observed behavior in real operational contexts over formal compliance with policies or self-reported intentions.

3. **Risk-Based Differentiation**
   Human-related risks are assessed and managed according to role, exposure, context, and impact, recognizing heterogeneity in user behavior and threat susceptibility.

4. **Socio-Technical Integration**
   Human behavior is addressed in conjunction with technological usability, workflow design, and organizational pressures, reflecting the socio-technical nature of cybersecurity.

5. **Continuous Measurement and Adaptation**
   CHARM adopts an iterative approach in which interventions are continuously evaluated and refined based on behavioral evidence and incident data.

6. **Standards and Regulatory Compatibility**
   The framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing cybersecurity standards and regulatory requirements, supporting governance, auditability, and accountability.

---

### 6.3. Framework Architecture

CHARM is structured as a **five-layer iterative framework**, forming a continuous feedback loop between assessment, intervention, measurement, and governance. Each layer addresses a distinct function while remaining interdependent with the others (Figure X).

#### 6.3.1. Layer 1: Human Risk Context Mapping

The first layer establishes a contextual understanding of how human factors manifest within a specific organizational environment. Drawing directly from the human-factor taxonomy identified in the SLR, this layer maps cognitive, behavioral, social, organizational, and socio-technical factors across roles, processes, and technologies.

Key activities include the identification of:

* High-exposure roles and functions,
* Workflow-induced pressures and security–productivity trade-offs,
* Usability frictions in security controls,
* Cultural and leadership influences on security behavior.

The output of this layer is a **human risk context map** that serves as the foundation for subsequent risk assessment and intervention design.

---

#### 6.3.2. Layer 2: Human Risk Assessment

Building on the contextual mapping, Layer 2 integrates human factors into formal cybersecurity risk assessment processes. Human-related risks are evaluated using dimensions analogous to traditional risk management constructs, including likelihood, impact, and existing mitigations, while explicitly incorporating behavioral and psychological drivers.

This layer produces a **human risk register** that prioritizes risks based on their potential contribution to cybersecurity incidents and their relevance to organizational objectives. By aligning human risk assessment with established enterprise risk management practices, CHARM facilitates integration with regulatory expectations such as those articulated under NIS2 .

---

#### 6.3.3. Layer 3: Adaptive Awareness and Human-Centric Controls

Layer 3 operationalizes risk treatment through adaptive, evidence-based interventions. In contrast to static awareness programs, CHARM emphasizes targeted interventions tailored to specific risk drivers identified in Layer 2.

Interventions may include:

* Contextualized micro-training addressing cognitive biases and social engineering tactics,
* Workflow-aligned security controls that reduce reliance on memory or vigilance,
* Usability-driven redesign of security mechanisms,
* Support mechanisms that enhance users’ perceived and actual self-efficacy.

Consistent with behavioral science evidence, these interventions focus on enabling secure behavior rather than increasing fear or perceived threat severity .

---

#### 6.3.4. Layer 4: Behavioral Monitoring and Metrics

To address methodological limitations identified in the literature—particularly the over-reliance on self-reported data—Layer 4 emphasizes the systematic collection of behavioral evidence. Metrics focus on observable actions, such as interaction with security controls, reporting behaviors, and deviations from secure workflows.

Multiple data sources are triangulated to improve validity and reduce bias. The resulting indicators serve both as leading signals of emerging human-related risks and as feedback mechanisms for evaluating intervention effectiveness.

---

#### 6.3.5. Layer 5: Governance and Continuous Improvement

The final layer embeds human-related cybersecurity risk within organizational governance structures. Responsibilities for human risk management are distributed across cybersecurity, human resources, operations, and executive leadership, reflecting the cross-cutting nature of the human factor.

This layer ensures that insights from incidents, assessments, and behavioral monitoring are systematically reintegrated into the framework, enabling continuous refinement of risk models and controls. In doing so, CHARM supports a cycle of organizational learning and resilience consistent with ENISA’s recommendations for iterative, evidence-based cybersecurity management .

---

### 6.4. Contribution and Implications

CHARM advances existing research and practice by providing a structured framework that translates empirical insights on human factors into actionable cybersecurity risk management processes. Unlike prevailing approaches that treat awareness as a discrete control, CHARM embeds human behavior throughout the risk lifecycle, from contextual analysis to governance.

The framework offers practical value for organizations seeking to operationalize human-centric cybersecurity strategies, while also providing a conceptual foundation for future empirical research on the effectiveness of behavior-based interventions and metrics.

Below is a **formal, publication-ready mapping section** that explicitly aligns **CHARM** with **ISO/IEC 27001:2022**, **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**, and **NIS2 Directive requirements**.
It is written to fit naturally as **Section 6.5 (or a standalone section)** following the CHARM framework description.

---

## 6.5. Alignment of CHARM with ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, and NIS2

To ensure practical applicability and regulatory relevance, the CHARM framework is explicitly designed to align with widely adopted cybersecurity standards and regulatory instruments. This alignment enables organizations to integrate CHARM without duplicating existing controls or governance structures. Instead, CHARM functions as a **human-centric overlay** that strengthens the treatment of human-related risks already implied—but often weakly operationalized—within ISO/IEC 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and the NIS2 Directive.

### 6.5.1. Mapping CHARM to ISO/IEC 27001:2022

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 recognizes the importance of human factors through controls related to awareness, competence, and human resource security. However, these controls are largely compliance-oriented and provide limited guidance on behavioral risk differentiation or measurement. CHARM extends these controls by embedding human behavior into the risk lifecycle rather than treating awareness as a standalone safeguard.

**Table 7. Mapping of CHARM Layers to ISO/IEC 27001:2022**

| CHARM Layer                                  | Relevant ISO/IEC 27001 Clauses / Controls                                         | Contribution of CHARM                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layer 1: Human Risk Context Mapping          | Clause 4 (Context of the organization); Clause 6.1 (Risk assessment); Annex A 5.4 | Introduces structured identification of human-centric risk contexts beyond asset-centric analysis |
| Layer 2: Human Risk Assessment               | Clause 6.1.2 (Information security risk assessment); Annex A 5.7                  | Operationalizes human behavior as a measurable risk factor within formal risk assessments         |
| Layer 3: Adaptive Awareness & Controls       | Annex A 6.3 (Information security awareness, education and training); Annex A 8.1 | Replaces generic training with risk-driven, role-specific interventions                           |
| Layer 4: Behavioral Monitoring & Metrics     | Clause 9.1 (Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation)                     | Emphasizes behavioral evidence and triangulated metrics rather than self-reporting                |
| Layer 5: Governance & Continuous Improvement | Clause 5 (Leadership); Clause 10 (Improvement)                                    | Embeds human risk into governance, management review, and continual improvement cycles            |

Through this mapping, CHARM enhances ISO/IEC 27001 compliance by strengthening its weakest area: the translation of awareness requirements into demonstrable, behavior-based risk reduction.

---

### 6.5.2. Mapping CHARM to NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

NIST CSF 2.0 explicitly expands its scope to include **governance, human roles, and organizational context**, making it particularly compatible with CHARM. Nevertheless, the CSF remains intentionally high-level and does not prescribe mechanisms for human risk differentiation or behavioral measurement.

**Table 8. Mapping of CHARM Layers to NIST CSF 2.0 Functions and Categories**

| NIST CSF Function | Relevant Categories                              | CHARM Contribution                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Govern            | GV.RM (Risk Management); GV.HR (Human Resources) | Provides a structured human risk model supporting governance-level decision-making |
| Identify          | ID.AM; ID.RA                                     | Extends asset and risk identification to include behavioral and cognitive exposure |
| Protect           | PR.AT (Awareness and Training); PR.AA            | Transforms awareness into adaptive, role-based behavioral controls                 |
| Detect            | DE.CM                                            | Introduces human-behavior indicators as leading detection signals                  |
| Respond           | RS.CO; RS.IM                                     | Incorporates human factors into incident response learning and adaptation          |
| Recover           | RC.IM                                            | Feeds behavioral insights into long-term resilience and improvement                |

CHARM therefore acts as an **implementation accelerator** for the CSF, particularly for the Govern and Protect functions, which depend heavily on human decision-making and organizational behavior.

---

### 6.5.3. Mapping CHARM to NIS2 Directive Requirements

The NIS2 Directive places explicit legal obligations on organizations to address **human resources security, cybersecurity training, effectiveness assessment, and continuous improvement**. ENISA’s technical implementation guidance further stresses that awareness must be evidence-based, role-specific, and measurable .

**Table 9. Mapping of CHARM Layers to NIS2 Requirements**

| NIS2 Requirement Area                | CHARM Alignment                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Risk management measures (Art. 21)   | Layer 2 integrates human behavior directly into cybersecurity risk management        |
| Cybersecurity training (Art. 21.2.g) | Layer 3 provides adaptive, role-specific awareness aligned with actual risk exposure |
| Human resources security             | Layer 1 maps role-based exposure and organizational pressures                        |
| Effectiveness assessment             | Layer 4 introduces behavioral metrics and continuous evaluation                      |
| Governance and accountability        | Layer 5 embeds human risk into executive oversight and review cycles                 |
| Continuous improvement               | Iterative feedback loop across all layers supports adaptive resilience               |

In contrast to minimal compliance approaches, CHARM supports **demonstrable due diligence** by providing traceability between human risk identification, mitigation, and measured outcomes—an increasingly important consideration for regulatory audits and enforcement.

---

### 6.5.4. Synthesis: CHARM as a Cross-Framework Integrator

Across all three instruments, CHARM fulfills a common unmet need: the **systematic operationalization of the human factor**. While ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, and NIS2 all acknowledge the importance of people, they largely stop short of prescribing how human behavior should be assessed, measured, and governed as a dynamic risk domain.

By explicitly mapping human factors across the risk lifecycle and embedding behavioral evidence into governance structures, CHARM serves as a unifying framework that enhances consistency, auditability, and effectiveness across standards and regulatory regimes. This positioning makes CHARM particularly suitable for organizations operating in regulated environments while also advancing the academic discourse on human-centric cybersecurity governance.

Below is a **journal-ready design specification** for a **CHARM visual model / figure**, written so that it can be:

* directly implemented by a graphic designer,
* recreated in tools like **Illustrator, PowerPoint, Figma, Visio**, or **LaTeX (TikZ)**,
* and clearly understood by reviewers without ambiguity.

I also include a **formal figure caption and in-text callout**, as expected in academic publications.

The figure illustrates CHARM as a five-layer, iterative framework integrating human factors into the cybersecurity risk lifecycle. The model progresses from contextual mapping of human-related risks through formal risk assessment, adaptive awareness and control implementation, and behaviour-based monitoring, culminating in governance and continuous improvement. A surrounding governance boundary highlights alignment with ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, and NIS2 requirements. Bidirectional feedback loops emphasize continuous learning and adaptation.

### 8. In-Text Reference Example

> *Figure X presents the CHARM framework as an iterative, risk-based model in which human behaviour is treated as a dynamic component of cybersecurity governance rather than a static compliance issue.*

Below is a **formal, academically structured CHARM maturity model with an accompanying assessment questionnaire**, designed to be:

* publishable as a **methods / framework extension section**,
* usable empirically (survey, audit, case study),
* compatible with ISO 27001 / NIST CSF / NIS2 assessments,
* and defensible to reviewers (clear constructs, observable indicators).

You can include this as **Section 6.6 (CHARM Maturity Model and Assessment Instrument)** or split it into two sections if space allows.

---

## 6.6. The CHARM Maturity Model

### 6.6.1. Purpose and Rationale

While the CHARM framework defines *what* components are required for effective human-centric cybersecurity risk management, organizations vary substantially in their capability to operationalize these components. To support incremental adoption, benchmarking, and longitudinal evaluation, a **CHARM maturity model** is proposed.

Maturity models are widely used in cybersecurity governance to translate abstract frameworks into staged capability development paths. In the context of human factors, a maturity-based approach is particularly appropriate, as behavioral change, cultural transformation, and governance integration occur progressively rather than instantaneously.

The CHARM maturity model evaluates organizational capability across the five CHARM layers, emphasizing **observable practices and evidence**, rather than policy existence alone.

---

## 6.6.2. CHARM Maturity Levels

CHARM defines **five maturity levels**, each reflecting a qualitatively different approach to managing human-related cybersecurity risk.

### Level 1 – Ad Hoc / Reactive

**Defining characteristics:**

* Human-related incidents are treated as isolated user failures
* Awareness activities are sporadic or incident-driven
* No formal consideration of human behavior in risk assessments

**Typical indicators:**

* Generic, infrequent security awareness training
* Post-incident blame focused on individuals
* Minimal leadership involvement

**Risk posture:**
Human risk is largely unmanaged and addressed only after incidents occur.

---

### Level 2 – Compliance-Oriented

**Defining characteristics:**

* Human factors are addressed primarily to satisfy compliance requirements
* Awareness training is standardized and policy-driven
* Metrics focus on completion rates rather than behavior

**Typical indicators:**

* Annual mandatory training
* Awareness included in ISO/NIS audits
* Limited role differentiation

**Risk posture:**
Human risk is acknowledged but treated as a static compliance obligation.

---

### Level 3 – Risk-Informed

**Defining characteristics:**

* Human behavior is incorporated into cybersecurity risk assessments
* Awareness activities are partially role-based
* Some behavioral data is collected

**Typical indicators:**

* Phishing simulations linked to risk registers
* Role-based training for high-risk functions
* Early attempts at behavioral metrics

**Risk posture:**
Human risk is actively managed but inconsistently integrated.

---

### Level 4 – Adaptive / Evidence-Based

**Defining characteristics:**

* Interventions are tailored to specific behavioral and contextual risks
* Behavioral metrics inform control adjustments
* Human factors are discussed at management level

**Typical indicators:**

* Adaptive awareness campaigns
* Evidence-based refinement of controls
* Cross-functional ownership (security, HR, operations)

**Risk posture:**
Human behavior is treated as a controllable and measurable risk domain.

---

### Level 5 – Integrated / Resilient

**Defining characteristics:**

* Human risk is embedded in cybersecurity governance and strategy
* Continuous learning loops exist across all CHARM layers
* Organizational culture actively supports secure behavior

**Typical indicators:**

* Board-level oversight of human risk
* Continuous behavioral sensing and improvement
* Security seen as enabling, not obstructing, work

**Risk posture:**
Human behavior is leveraged as a strategic security capability.

### Table 10. CHARM Maturity Levels Overview

| Level | Maturity Name       | Core Orientation | Human Risk Treatment |
| ----- | ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 1     | Ad Hoc              | Reactive         | Ignored or blamed    |
| 2     | Compliance-Oriented | Policy-driven    | Generic mitigation   |
| 3     | Risk-Informed       | Analytical       | Partial integration  |
| 4     | Adaptive            | Evidence-based   | Actively managed     |
| 5     | Integrated          | Strategic        | Organizational asset |

## 6.7. CHARM Assessment Questionnaire

### 6.7.1. Structure of the Instrument

The **CHARM Assessment Questionnaire** is designed to evaluate maturity across the five CHARM layers using **Likert-scale items** anchored in observable organizational practices.

* Response scale: 1 (Strongly disagree) – 5 (Strongly agree)
* Items can be aggregated per layer and mapped to maturity levels
* Suitable for surveys, interviews, or audit workshops

---

### 6.7.2. Assessment Items by CHARM Layer

#### Layer 1 – Human Risk Context Mapping

1. Our organization systematically identifies roles with elevated human-related cyber risk.
2. Workload, time pressure, and usability issues are considered when analyzing security incidents.
3. Security risks related to cognitive or behavioral factors are explicitly documented.

---

#### Layer 2 – Human Risk Assessment

4. Human behavior is explicitly included in cybersecurity risk assessments.
5. Human-related risks are prioritized based on likelihood and impact.
6. Risk assessments distinguish between different categories of human-related risk (e.g. cognitive bias, social engineering, workload stress).

---

#### Layer 3 – Adaptive Awareness & Human-Centric Controls

7. Security awareness activities are tailored to specific roles or risk profiles.
8. Awareness initiatives are adjusted based on observed user behavior.
9. Security controls are designed to minimize disruption to users’ primary work tasks.

---

#### Layer 4 – Behaviour Monitoring & Metrics

10. We measure actual security-related behaviors rather than relying solely on self-reported data.
11. Multiple data sources are used to evaluate awareness effectiveness.
12. Behavioral metrics are used to refine security controls and training.

---

#### Layer 5 – Governance & Continuous Improvement

13. Senior management actively reviews human-related cybersecurity risks.
14. Responsibility for human-related cyber risk is shared across functions (e.g. security, HR, operations).
15. Lessons learned from incidents lead to systematic improvements in awareness and controls.

### 6.7.3. Scoring and Interpretation

Scores may be interpreted as follows:

| Average Score | CHARM Maturity Level          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1.0 – 1.9     | Level 1 – Ad Hoc              |
| 2.0 – 2.9     | Level 2 – Compliance-Oriented |
| 3.0 – 3.4     | Level 3 – Risk-Informed       |
| 3.5 – 4.4     | Level 4 – Adaptive            |
| 4.5 – 5.0     | Level 5 – Integrated          |

Scores can be analyzed:

* per layer (to identify weaknesses),
* longitudinally (to measure progress),
* comparatively (across business units).

---

## 6.8. Research and Practical Applications

The CHARM maturity model and questionnaire provide a foundation for:

* empirical validation of the framework,
* benchmarking across organizations and sectors,
* longitudinal studies on behavioral change,
* regulatory readiness assessments under NIS2.

From a research perspective, the instrument enables hypothesis testing regarding the relationship between maturity level and incident frequency, resilience, or security culture indicators.

---

## 6.9. Summary

By coupling the CHARM framework with a structured maturity model and assessment instrument, this study advances both theory and practice. CHARM not only conceptualizes the human factor in cybersecurity but also provides a measurable pathway for organizations to evolve from compliance-driven awareness toward resilient, human-centric cybersecurity governance.

If you want next, I can:

* Validate this questionnaire against **TPB / PMT constructs** for methodological rigor
* Design **a short-form executive self-assessment**
* Create **a case-study scoring example**
* Prepare **a survey-ready appendix** (as journals often require)

Just say the word.
