# CHARM Assessment Questionnaire

The **CHARM Assessment Questionnaire** is designed to evaluate maturity across the five CHARM (Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management) layers using **Likert-scale items** anchored in observable organisational practices. It can be used in surveys, interviews, or audit workshops, and scores can be aggregated per layer and mapped to the [CHARM maturity levels](08-Maturity-Model.md).

---

## Structure of the Instrument

- **Response scale:** 1 (Strongly disagree) – 5 (Strongly agree).
- **Aggregation:** Items can be averaged per layer and/or overall; overall average is mapped to a single maturity level for communication.
- **Use:** Surveys (organisation-wide or by unit), structured interviews, or facilitated audit workshops where participants rate each item with justification.

## Assessment Items by CHARM Layer

### Layer 1 – Human Risk Context Mapping

1. Our organisation systematically identifies roles with elevated human-related cyber risk.
2. Workload, time pressure, and usability issues are considered when analysing security incidents.
3. Security risks related to cognitive or behavioural factors are explicitly documented.

---

### Layer 2 – Human Risk Assessment

4. Human behaviour is explicitly included in cybersecurity risk assessments.
5. Human-related risks are prioritised based on likelihood and impact.
6. Risk assessments distinguish between different categories of human-related risk (e.g. cognitive bias, social engineering, workload stress).

---

### Layer 3 – Adaptive Awareness & Human-Centric Controls

7. Security awareness activities are tailored to specific roles or risk profiles.
8. Awareness initiatives are adjusted based on observed user behaviour.
9. Security controls are designed to minimise disruption to users’ primary work tasks.

---

### Layer 4 – Behaviour Monitoring & Metrics

10. We measure actual security-related behaviours rather than relying solely on self-reported data.
11. Multiple data sources are used to evaluate awareness effectiveness.
12. Behavioural metrics are used to refine security controls and training.

---

### Layer 5 – Governance & Continuous Improvement

13. Senior management actively reviews human-related cybersecurity risks.
14. Responsibility for human-related cyber risk is shared across functions (e.g. security, HR, operations).
15. Lessons learned from incidents lead to systematic improvements in awareness and controls.

## Scoring and Interpretation

Compute the **average score** across all 15 items (or across the items for a single layer). Map the overall average to a CHARM maturity level as follows:

| Average Score | CHARM Maturity Level          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1.0 – 1.9     | Level 1 – Ad Hoc              |
| 2.0 – 2.9     | Level 2 – Compliance-Oriented |
| 3.0 – 3.4     | Level 3 – Risk-Informed       |
| 3.5 – 4.4     | Level 4 – Adaptive            |
| 4.5 – 5.0     | Level 5 – Integrated          |

### How to Analyse Scores

- **Per layer:** Compute the average for items 1–3 (Layer 1), 4–6 (Layer 2), and so on. Identify layers with the lowest scores as improvement priorities; refer to the corresponding layer document ([02](02-Layer-1-Human-Risk-Context-Mapping.md)–[06](06-Layer-5-Governance-and-Continuous-Improvement.md)) for what “good” looks like.
- **Longitudinally:** Re-administer the questionnaire at intervals (e.g. annually); track overall maturity level and per-layer averages to measure progress.
- **Comparatively:** If multiple business units or populations are assessed, compare scores across units to identify strengths and gaps and to share good practice.

## Relationship to the Framework

- The 15 items align with the five CHARM layers; each layer has three items.
- Maturity levels are defined in [08-Maturity-Model.md](08-Maturity-Model.md).
- For the full layer specifications that the items reflect, see [02–06](02-Layer-1-Human-Risk-Context-Mapping.md).
