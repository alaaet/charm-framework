# Layer 3: Adaptive Awareness and Human-Centric Controls

**Layer 3** of the CHARM (Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management) framework operationalises risk treatment through **adaptive, evidence-based interventions**. In contrast to generic, one-size-fits-all awareness programs, CHARM emphasises targeted interventions tailored to specific risk drivers identified in Layer 2, with a focus on enabling secure behaviour (coping capacity and self-efficacy) rather than fear or threat escalation.

---

## Objective

Replace generic awareness programmes with **adaptive, risk-driven interventions** that address the actual drivers of human-related risk: cognitive bias, social engineering susceptibility, workload stress, low self-efficacy, and usability friction. Interventions should be role-specific, contextual, continuous, and aligned with behavioural science evidence.

## Intervention Types: Risk Driver → Strategy

Interventions are mapped to the risk drivers identified in Layer 2. The table below links each driver to a recommended intervention strategy.

| Risk Driver        | Intervention Strategy                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Cognitive bias     | Bias-aware micro-training             |
| Social engineering  | Influence-technique literacy          |
| Workload stress     | Workflow-aligned controls             |
| Low self-efficacy  | Skill-building & just-in-time support |
| Usability friction | Security-by-design adjustments        |

- **Bias-aware micro-training** — Short, contextualised learning that helps people recognise their own biases (e.g. urgency, authority) and apply simple checks before acting (e.g. on links or requests).
- **Influence-technique literacy** — Education on common persuasion techniques used in phishing and social engineering (authority, urgency, scarcity, social proof) so that employees can recognise and question them rather than comply on autopilot.
- **Workflow-aligned controls** — Redesign security so it fits into how work is done (e.g. default secure options, automated checks, reduced steps) rather than relying on memory or extra vigilance under pressure.
- **Skill-building & just-in-time support** — Training that builds actual capability (e.g. how to report, how to verify) and in-context support (e.g. “Is this email safe?” channel, clear guidance at the point of action) to increase perceived and actual self-efficacy.
- **Security-by-design adjustments** — Improve the usability and fit of security mechanisms (passwords, MFA, encryption, approval flows) so that secure behaviour is the path of least resistance; “fix security” rather than only “fix the human.”

## Key Characteristics of CHARM Interventions

- **Role-specific** — Content and controls are tailored to the risk profile and tasks of the audience (e.g. finance, admins, developers), not a single organisation-wide course.
- **Contextual** — Linked to real tasks and situations (e.g. handling invoices, dealing with urgent requests, using public or shared devices) rather than abstract policy.
- **Continuous** — Not episodic (e.g. annual training only); reinforced through ongoing nudges, just-in-time support, and periodic refreshers aligned with risk and behaviour data.
- **Focused on coping capacity, not fear** — Evidence (including ENISA’s reviews) suggests that increasing users’ ability and belief that they can respond effectively (response efficacy, self-efficacy) is more effective than increasing threat severity or fear. Interventions should enable and support, not only warn.

## Link to ENISA Practitioner Model

ENISA’s guidelines for practitioners emphasise a cycle of Awareness → Analyse → Plan → Implementation → Evaluation. The “Plan” and “Implementation” stages recommend matching the **cause** of non-compliance to the **organisational response**:

- If the cause is **capability** (e.g. lack of skill or knowledge), responses include skill-building and redesign of policies/tools so that secure behaviour is achievable.
- If the cause is **motivation**, responses include culture, incentives, and visible organisational reaction to breaches (without blame-only approaches).
- If the cause is **opportunity** (e.g. friction, poor design), responses include engaging users in security design, security champions, and reducing friction so that the secure option is the easy option.

CHARM’s intervention table above is consistent with this: it directs organisations to “fix security” (usability, workflow, design) where appropriate, and to build skills and support where the main gap is capability or self-efficacy, rather than defaulting to more awareness or fear-based messaging.

## Relationship to Other Layers

- **From Layer 2:** Prioritised risks and risk drivers determine which interventions are deployed, for which roles, and in what order.
- **To Layer 4:** Interventions should be evaluated using behavioural metrics (did behaviour change? did reporting increase? did workarounds decrease?) so that effectiveness is measured and refined.
- **From Layer 5:** Governance ensures that intervention design and resourcing are aligned with human risk priorities and that lessons from incidents feed into future interventions.
