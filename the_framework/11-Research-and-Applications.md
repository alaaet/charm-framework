# Research and Practical Applications

This document summarises the **contribution and implications** of the CHARM (Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management) framework and outlines **research and practical applications** of the framework, maturity model, and assessment questionnaire. It supports both academic use (e.g. in a paper’s discussion or implications section) and practical use (e.g. justifying adoption or regulatory readiness).

## Contribution

CHARM advances existing research and practice by providing a structured framework that **translates empirical insights on human factors into actionable cybersecurity risk management processes**. Unlike prevailing approaches that treat awareness as a discrete control, CHARM embeds human behaviour throughout the risk lifecycle—from contextual analysis (Layer 1) through risk assessment (Layer 2), adaptive interventions (Layer 3), behavioural measurement (Layer 4), and governance (Layer 5).

The framework addresses limitations identified in the literature: fragmentation of human-factor treatment in standards, over-reliance on generic awareness and self-report, and weak integration of human risk into formal risk management and governance. CHARM offers both **practical value** for organisations seeking to operationalise human-centric cybersecurity strategies and a **conceptual foundation** for future empirical research on the effectiveness of behaviour-based interventions and metrics.

## Practical Value

- **Operationalising human-centric strategies** — Organisations can use the five layers and the [maturity model](08-Maturity-Model.md) to design, implement, and improve human risk management in a structured way, rather than relying on ad hoc or compliance-only approaches.
- **Regulatory readiness** — CHARM supports **demonstrable due diligence** under NIS2 and alignment with ISO 27001 and NIST CSF (see [07-Alignment-with-Standards.md](07-Alignment-with-Standards.md)), providing traceability from human risk identification through mitigation to measured outcomes—important for audits and enforcement.
- **Stakeholder alignment** — The framework gives CISOs, HR, operations, and leadership a shared vocabulary and a clear place for human risk in governance and review cycles.

## Research Applications

The CHARM maturity model and [assessment questionnaire](09-Assessment-Questionnaire.md) provide a foundation for:

- **Empirical validation of the framework** — Testing whether organisations that score higher on CHARM maturity show better outcomes (e.g. fewer human-related incidents, higher reporting rates, better resilience indicators).
- **Benchmarking across organisations and sectors** — Comparing maturity levels and per-layer scores to identify sector norms, good practice, and gaps.
- **Longitudinal studies on behavioural change** — Tracking maturity and behavioural metrics over time to study the effect of interventions and governance changes.
- **Regulatory readiness assessments** — Using the questionnaire and maturity levels as one input to assess readiness for NIS2 or other regimes that emphasise human resources security, training, and effectiveness assessment.

From a research perspective, the instrument enables **hypothesis testing** regarding the relationship between CHARM maturity level and incident frequency, resilience, or security culture indicators.

## Summary

By coupling the CHARM framework with a structured **maturity model** and **assessment instrument**, this work advances both theory and practice. CHARM not only conceptualises the human factor in cybersecurity but also provides a **measurable pathway** for organisations to evolve from compliance-driven awareness toward resilient, human-centric cybersecurity governance. The framework, maturity levels, and questionnaire together support implementation, evaluation, and research in human-related cybersecurity risk management.
