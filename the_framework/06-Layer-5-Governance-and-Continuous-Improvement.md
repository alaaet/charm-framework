# Layer 5: Governance and Continuous Improvement

**Layer 5** of the CHARM (Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management) framework embeds human-related cybersecurity risk within **organisational governance and decision-making**. It ensures that human risk has clear ownership, board-level visibility, and a formal place in review and improvement cycles, and that insights from incidents and behavioural monitoring are systematically reintegrated into the framework.

## Objective

Embed human risk into **cybersecurity governance and decision-making** so that it is sustained, auditable, and aligned with regulatory expectations. Responsibilities are distributed across cybersecurity, human resources, operations, and executive leadership, reflecting the cross-cutting nature of the human factor. The layer also closes the feedback loop: incident and behaviour data drive reassessment and refinement of risk models and controls.

## Governance Elements

- **Board-level visibility of human risk** — Human-related risks, key metrics, and material incidents are reported to the board or equivalent so that human risk is treated as a strategic and oversight concern, not only an operational one.
- **Clear ownership** — Designated ownership across CISO (or equivalent), HR, and Operations (and other relevant functions) for human risk context (Layer 1), assessment (Layer 2), interventions (Layer 3), and metrics (Layer 4). Roles and responsibilities are documented and reviewed.
- **Integration with incident post-mortems** — When incidents occur, human factors are considered in root-cause analysis (workload, usability, culture, training) and lessons are fed into risk assessment and intervention design, not only technical remediation.
- **Formal review cycles** — Periodic review (e.g. annual or aligned with risk cycle) of the human risk register, intervention effectiveness, and KPIs, with decisions on acceptance, mitigation, and improvement actions.

## Continuous Loop

Layer 5 implements the continuous improvement cycle that connects all CHARM layers:

1. **Incident and behaviour data feed back into risk assessment** — Outcomes from Layer 4 (metrics, incidents, near-misses) are used to update Layer 2 (likelihood, impact, mitigators) and to validate or challenge Layer 1 context (e.g. new pressure points, new workarounds).
2. **Controls and awareness are adjusted accordingly** — Layer 3 interventions are refined, expanded, or retired based on evidence: what worked, what did not, and for whom.
3. **Organisational learning is institutionalised** — Lessons are captured, shared, and used to update policies, training, and tooling so that the organisation improves over time rather than repeating the same patterns.

This cycle is consistent with ENISA’s recommendations for iterative, evidence-based cybersecurity management and with standard continual improvement expectations in ISO 27001 and NIS2.

## Regulatory Fit

Layer 5 supports NIS2 requirements on:

- **Security training** — Governance ensures that training (Layer 3) is aligned with risk, targeted, and evaluated (Layer 4), and that effectiveness is assessed and reported.
- **Human resources security** — HR and security jointly own aspects of human risk (e.g. role-based exposure, onboarding, termination, and behaviour-related processes).
- **Effectiveness assessment** — Formal review cycles and behavioural metrics provide evidence that risk-management measures are evaluated for effectiveness, as required under NIS2.
- **Continuous improvement** — The feedback loop and review cycles demonstrate that the organisation learns from incidents and data and adapts its measures.

## Relationship to Other Layers

- **Layer 1–4:** Governance sets the expectations, ownership, and review cadence for context mapping, risk assessment, interventions, and metrics.
- **From Layer 4:** Metrics and incidents are the primary inputs for governance reporting and for decisions that feed back into Layers 1–3.
- **To external stakeholders:** Governance supports auditability and regulatory readiness by providing traceability from human risk identification through mitigation to measured outcomes.
