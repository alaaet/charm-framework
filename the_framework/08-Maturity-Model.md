# The CHARM Maturity Model

While the CHARM (Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management) framework defines *what* components are required for effective human-centric cybersecurity risk management, organisations vary substantially in their capability to operationalise these components. To support incremental adoption, benchmarking, and longitudinal evaluation, a **CHARM maturity model** is proposed. It evaluates organisational capability across the five CHARM layers, emphasising **observable practices and evidence**, rather than policy existence alone.

Conceptually, CHARM maturity is compatible with staged improvement approaches used in other frameworks (e.g. SIM3’s parameter-based maturity); CHARM uses its own five levels (Ad Hoc through Integrated) tailored to human risk management.

## Purpose and Rationale

Maturity models are widely used in cybersecurity governance to translate abstract frameworks into staged capability development paths. In the context of human factors, a maturity-based approach is particularly appropriate, because behavioural change, cultural transformation, and governance integration occur progressively rather than instantaneously. The CHARM maturity model allows organisations to:

- **Adopt incrementally** — Move from one level to the next as capability and evidence grow.
- **Benchmark** — Compare maturity across units, or against sector or regulatory expectations.
- **Evaluate longitudinally** — Track progress over time using the same levels and the associated [assessment questionnaire](09-Assessment-Questionnaire.md).

## CHARM Maturity Levels

CHARM defines **five maturity levels**, each reflecting a qualitatively different approach to managing human-related cybersecurity risk.

---

### Level 1 – Ad Hoc / Reactive

**Defining characteristics:**

- Human-related incidents are treated as isolated user failures.
- Awareness activities are sporadic or incident-driven.
- No formal consideration of human behaviour in risk assessments.

**Typical indicators:**

- Generic, infrequent security awareness training.
- Post-incident blame focused on individuals.
- Minimal leadership involvement.

**Risk posture:** Human risk is largely unmanaged and addressed only after incidents occur.

---

### Level 2 – Compliance-Oriented

**Defining characteristics:**

- Human factors are addressed primarily to satisfy compliance requirements.
- Awareness training is standardised and policy-driven.
- Metrics focus on completion rates rather than behaviour.

**Typical indicators:**

- Annual mandatory training.
- Awareness included in ISO/NIS audits.
- Limited role differentiation.

**Risk posture:** Human risk is acknowledged but treated as a static compliance obligation.

---

### Level 3 – Risk-Informed

**Defining characteristics:**

- Human behaviour is incorporated into cybersecurity risk assessments.
- Awareness activities are partially role-based.
- Some behavioural data is collected.

**Typical indicators:**

- Phishing simulations linked to risk registers.
- Role-based training for high-risk functions.
- Early attempts at behavioural metrics.

**Risk posture:** Human risk is actively managed but inconsistently integrated.

---

### Level 4 – Adaptive / Evidence-Based

**Defining characteristics:**

- Interventions are tailored to specific behavioural and contextual risks.
- Behavioural metrics inform control adjustments.
- Human factors are discussed at management level.

**Typical indicators:**

- Adaptive awareness campaigns.
- Evidence-based refinement of controls.
- Cross-functional ownership (security, HR, operations).

**Risk posture:** Human behaviour is treated as a controllable and measurable risk domain.

---

### Level 5 – Integrated / Resilient

**Defining characteristics:**

- Human risk is embedded in cybersecurity governance and strategy.
- Continuous learning loops exist across all CHARM layers.
- Organisational culture actively supports secure behaviour.

**Typical indicators:**

- Board-level oversight of human risk.
- Continuous behavioural sensing and improvement.
- Security seen as enabling, not obstructing, work.

**Risk posture:** Human behaviour is leveraged as a strategic security capability.

## CHARM Maturity Levels Overview

| Level | Maturity Name       | Core Orientation | Human Risk Treatment |
| ----- | ------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| 1     | Ad Hoc              | Reactive         | Ignored or blamed    |
| 2     | Compliance-Oriented | Policy-driven    | Generic mitigation   |
| 3     | Risk-Informed       | Analytical       | Partial integration  |
| 4     | Adaptive            | Evidence-based   | Actively managed     |
| 5     | Integrated          | Strategic        | Organisational asset |

## Using the Maturity Model

- **Assessment:** Use the [CHARM Assessment Questionnaire](09-Assessment-Questionnaire.md) to score the organisation (or a unit) and map average scores to the maturity levels above.
- **Gap analysis:** Compare current level to target level and prioritise improvements by CHARM layer (see [02–06](02-Layer-1-Human-Risk-Context-Mapping.md) for layer specifications).
- **Governance:** Report maturity in governance and risk committees; use it to support regulatory readiness (e.g. NIS2) and alignment with [07-Alignment-with-Standards.md](07-Alignment-with-Standards.md).
