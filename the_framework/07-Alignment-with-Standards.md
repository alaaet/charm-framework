# Alignment of CHARM with ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, and NIS2

To ensure practical applicability and regulatory relevance, the **CHARM (Cybersecurity Human Awareness & Risk Management)** framework is explicitly designed to align with widely adopted cybersecurity standards and regulatory instruments. This alignment enables organisations to integrate CHARM without duplicating existing controls or governance structures. Instead, CHARM functions as a **human-centric overlay** that strengthens the treatment of human-related risks already implied—but often weakly operationalised—within ISO/IEC 27001, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF), and the NIS2 Directive.

## 6.5.1. Mapping CHARM to ISO/IEC 27001:2022

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 recognises the importance of human factors through controls related to awareness, competence, and human resource security. However, these controls are largely compliance-oriented and provide limited guidance on behavioural risk differentiation or measurement. CHARM extends these controls by embedding human behaviour into the risk lifecycle rather than treating awareness as a standalone safeguard.

**Table 1. Mapping of CHARM Layers to ISO/IEC 27001:2022**

| CHARM Layer                                  | Relevant ISO/IEC 27001 Clauses / Controls                                         | Contribution of CHARM                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layer 1: Human Risk Context Mapping          | Clause 4 (Context of the organization); Clause 6.1 (Risk assessment); Annex A 5.4 | Introduces structured identification of human-centric risk contexts beyond asset-centric analysis |
| Layer 2: Human Risk Assessment               | Clause 6.1.2 (Information security risk assessment); Annex A 5.7                  | Operationalises human behaviour as a measurable risk factor within formal risk assessments         |
| Layer 3: Adaptive Awareness & Controls       | Annex A 6.3 (Information security awareness, education and training); Annex A 8.1 | Replaces generic training with risk-driven, role-specific interventions                           |
| Layer 4: Behavioural Monitoring & Metrics     | Clause 9.1 (Monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation)                     | Emphasises behavioural evidence and triangulated metrics rather than self-reporting                |
| Layer 5: Governance & Continuous Improvement | Clause 5 (Leadership); Clause 10 (Improvement)                                     | Embeds human risk into governance, management review, and continual improvement cycles            |

Through this mapping, CHARM enhances ISO/IEC 27001 compliance by strengthening its weakest area: the translation of awareness requirements into demonstrable, behaviour-based risk reduction.

## 6.5.2. Mapping CHARM to NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0

NIST CSF 2.0 explicitly expands its scope to include **governance, human roles, and organisational context**, making it particularly compatible with CHARM. Nevertheless, the CSF remains intentionally high-level and does not prescribe mechanisms for human risk differentiation or behavioural measurement.

**Table 2. Mapping of CHARM Layers to NIST CSF 2.0 Functions and Categories**

| NIST CSF Function | Relevant Categories                              | CHARM Contribution                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Govern            | GV.RM (Risk Management); GV.HR (Human Resources) | Provides a structured human risk model supporting governance-level decision-making |
| Identify          | ID.AM; ID.RA                                     | Extends asset and risk identification to include behavioural and cognitive exposure |
| Protect           | PR.AT (Awareness and Training); PR.AA             | Transforms awareness into adaptive, role-based behavioural controls                 |
| Detect            | DE.CM                                            | Introduces human-behaviour indicators as leading detection signals                  |
| Respond           | RS.CO; RS.IM                                     | Incorporates human factors into incident response learning and adaptation          |
| Recover           | RC.IM                                            | Feeds behavioural insights into long-term resilience and improvement               |

CHARM therefore acts as an **implementation accelerator** for the CSF, particularly for the Govern and Protect functions, which depend heavily on human decision-making and organisational behaviour.

## 6.5.3. Mapping CHARM to NIS2 Directive Requirements

The NIS2 Directive places explicit legal obligations on organisations to address **human resources security, cybersecurity training, effectiveness assessment, and continuous improvement**. ENISA’s technical implementation guidance further stresses that awareness must be evidence-based, role-specific, and measurable.

**Table 3. Mapping of CHARM Layers to NIS2 Requirements**

| NIS2 Requirement Area                | CHARM Alignment                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Risk management measures (Art. 21)   | Layer 2 integrates human behaviour directly into cybersecurity risk management        |
| Cybersecurity training (Art. 21.2.g) | Layer 3 provides adaptive, role-specific awareness aligned with actual risk exposure  |
| Human resources security             | Layer 1 maps role-based exposure and organisational pressures                        |
| Effectiveness assessment             | Layer 4 introduces behavioural metrics and continuous evaluation                      |
| Governance and accountability        | Layer 5 embeds human risk into executive oversight and review cycles                 |
| Continuous improvement               | Iterative feedback loop across all layers supports adaptive resilience               |

In contrast to minimal compliance approaches, CHARM supports **demonstrable due diligence** by providing traceability between human risk identification, mitigation, and measured outcomes—an increasingly important consideration for regulatory audits and enforcement.

## 6.5.4. Synthesis: CHARM as a Cross-Framework Integrator

Across all three instruments, CHARM fulfils a common unmet need: the **systematic operationalisation of the human factor**. While ISO/IEC 27001, NIST CSF, and NIS2 all acknowledge the importance of people, they largely stop short of prescribing how human behaviour should be assessed, measured, and governed as a dynamic risk domain.

By explicitly mapping human factors across the risk lifecycle and embedding behavioural evidence into governance structures, CHARM serves as a unifying framework that enhances consistency, auditability, and effectiveness across standards and regulatory regimes. This positioning makes CHARM particularly suitable for organisations operating in regulated environments while also advancing the academic discourse on human-centric cybersecurity governance.
